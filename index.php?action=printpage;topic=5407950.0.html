					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Apparently, it&#039;s the idea all along for most when it comes to making an altcoin investment in the bear market. The coins in the top 10 often seens to stand out and holds promises and is mostly believed to have less potency of dumping as this is often the case for altcoins during the long winters but, we know that&#039;s not entirely what is obtainable.<br />Looking at the presented table right now, I could note how XRP have fallen over the years and it&#039;s surprising its been a major competitor to ETH and now, its gradually falling off the top 10. That&#039;s the reality to it as per market capitalization, its time definitive and means very little.<br /><br />Bitcoin becomes the only coin that is sure to maintain its position as per being pioneer currency and the changes that occurs on the coin is what is reflected on other coins. Its bound to lead everytime.</div>

If you choose to diversify your cryptocurrency investment before you can accommodate it, your money may be swallowed up or reduced in the process of being invested in speculated cryptocurrencies that they told you will last the test of time. <br /><br />-You can diversify in crypto for the short-term, but for long-term investments in cryptocurrency, bitcoin should be your number one choice always.<br /><br />- If you must diversify your investment, don&#039;t over do it. Pick one or two other coins in addition to BTC and be content. Buying over 10 cryptocurrency may do you no good.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It&#039;s possible that over the next few years for the top position and becoming a king will be the same as in previous years.<br />This clearly proves that bitcoin is quite feasible for those who already understand and indeed until now the movement of bitcoin will still be something interesting because until now especially with the news everywhere that makes them more exposed and will definitely be more in demand.<br />About top 10 coins don&#039;t know why I just always see some of them for altcoins.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Most definitely, btc should be about %70 of a portfolio for stability and most especially for a long-term goal guarantee. It is true that most of the top 10 we have in the market today may not be in a few years to come, several factors can result in that, but as long as btc covers more than half of your investment I believe the impact (if any unexpected eventualities occur) will not be too the detriment. So far only very few alts have a long-term goal capability imo.</div>

Let&#039;s take for example such assets as Ripple, Bitcoin Cash or Tron. Being large, in terms of capitalization, projects, they can hardly be called an effective investment of your funds (unless, of course, you are an early investor). These projects stopped growing in 2018 and since then have continued to stagnate, not even close to half of their former ATH for a long time.</div>

If I could choose the overview, I would like to see Bitcoin with all the biggest companies in the world. Currently in first position is Apple with 2.4 trillion € market value and Microsoft with 1.8 €. Bitcoin currently with 455 billion.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Why only starting in 2015? Bitcoin is number one since the day it was born and it remains number one until now, more than a decade later. It will probably remain to be the number one in the next decades to come. The rest of the list come and go. <br /><br />There was actually a short video clip on the changes that happened in the top 10 since altcoins came into the market. I cannot find it anymore. The message was stronger with that one because it showed that no single altcoin in the top 10 during the early years of crypto remains there today. With Bitcoin, of course, as the exception. </div>

If you choose to diversify your cryptocurrency investment before you can accommodate it, your money may be swallowed up or reduced in the process of being invested in speculated cryptocurrencies that they told you will last the test of time. <br /><br />-You can diversify in crypto for the short-term, but for long-term investments in cryptocurrency, bitcoin should be your number one choice always.<br /><br />- If you must diversify your investment, don&#039;t over do it. Pick one or two other coins in addition to BTC and be content. Buying over 10 cryptocurrency may do you no good.<br /><br /></div>Totally agree. I believe some of us get these ideas twisted, Investment should always be for the long term and Bitcoin is the best case in this and a few Alts can be looked at as well but some think because long-term investment is always being argued then they can put money in just any Alts for that amount of time. Nothing wrong with diversifying but most Alts are good for short-term trading. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">There&#039;s no doubt that it&#039;s true, that bitcoin is the best to date. Bitcoin is still the reference for other coins, even in terms of price movements. How could it not be because bitcoin is the pioneer of the birth of the cryptocurrency world which is now much loved by big investors. Even now many small investors have entered. It is very difficult to compete with the control of bitcoin.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It has been more than a decade since bitcoin expanded the currency into the digital space of the internet. And since then, bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency in the world and continues to be king.<br />As this is a blazing crypto footprint, mainstream acceptance will always put it ahead of other cryptos, although in the years to come there may be a shift but in the end bitcoin remains king.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">People should rather forget about profitability.... and rather focus on increasing Bitcoin&#039;s adoption. Higher adoption will make it even more dominant in the market and it will sustain a increase in it&#039;s price.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />We cannot have a Bitcoin with &quot;extreme&quot; volatility that are dominating the market, because it is not good for Bitcoin as a stable currency.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This really means little. BTC had a significant head start compared to other coins and in that early period managed to position itself not as one of the options, but rather as crypto itself. So when a lot of people think of crypto they associate it with BTC. But it&#039;s just an option, other coins offer different approaches and have diversified their goals so it&#039;s more like a smorgasbord than a main dish with plenty of side dishes. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If we can increase the awareness of using Bitcoin except trading tool, then its price will automatically go up where the bearish market will not be able to weaken it. There is no logical reason to fall down bitcoin. Note that Bitcoin is the only decentralized currency but others are centralized. Use case, market-cap, acceptance and popularity everywhere bitcoin considered as the king. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Bitcoin is the king of crypto, we&#039;ve heard about it a lot, and it&#039;s a proven fact over the years.<br />Of course it is not misleading if we believe that the crypto that deserves to be called the king is bitcoin, that&#039;s because bitcoin is able to maintain its value compared to other altcoin. But if we are investors looking to maximize profits, then I don&#039;t think we should ignore the top 10 altcoin either. I&#039;m sure not everyone will agree, but asset diversification is a good thing and not too bad to consider.<br /><br />I expect bitcoin to be irreplaceable in the long term although now some altcoins seem to be more developed than ever. For its use case as a currency, bitcoin is still the first due to its decentralized, but surely other products will try to gain a place in the community as well.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Really bitcoin is the King of the Crypto space. As for me, the only Crypto currency that will not fade away is bitcoin. Example, when LUNA was in the Crypto space, people were saying that Luna was one of the best coin and they invited in it, when Luna crashed, they lost a lot from it. <br />In any firm in the world, there are specific years assigned to the permanency or further development of a company. And the years are estimated for five (5) years. That is if a firm stand in operation for the stipulated time of the five years or more, there is a possibility that the firm or company&nbsp; will stay for a long period of time. And bitcoin has stayed (existed) for 13 years. Bitcoin in the Crypto currency world is all year high.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This is why it&#039;s said to invest in Bitcoin as it&#039;s the only coin holding the top position for all these years while all others have gone out of market.You should be holding some part in bitcoin to secure your future but can also diversify your portfolio with some altcoins you like but most of them are turning out to be scam these days so be wise to avoid them and stick to some top one&#039;s only if you wish to do so.<br /><br />But yes bitcoin is the king of the market and there&#039;s no doubt in that.</div>

I&#039;m sure for next year where Bitcoin will still be the same as now, which is at number 1, so Bitcoin deserves to be said as King because its position is difficult to be taken over by others.<br /></div>No doubt about that. Since I have known bitcoin, I consider that the altcoin market will always follow where bitcoin moves because bitcoin is the first coin in the crypto and lead the market. The position on the number 2 and the next number will always change but bitcoin is still in the position at number 1. That is why bitcoin will remain as King in the crypto market. Besides that, people who know the crypto market will hear about bitcoin first than the other coins, although right now, people hear about the new project that releases out there, but they will know that bitcoin is the leader in the crypto market.</div>

No altcoin is capable of gaining the amount of trust and authority that Bitcoin Core has. Even that imposter BCH altcoin was in the Top 10 list for a while. That&#039;s how strong Bitcoin actually is. The altcoins, that are pretending to be Bitcoin actually get to top only because they pretend to be Bitcoin. ;D<br />I&#039;ve asked myself multiple times during all those years. Do we really need altcoins? Having competition on the market is great, but no other coin can compete with Bitcoin.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Talking about popularity, usability and also the forerunner then it is indeed feasible to be make bitcoin as the king of cryptocurrencies, regarding popularity, perhaps there is no other crypto that can compete with bitcoin so far as well as its usefulness which can be said to be multifunctional both as an investment tool and a means of payment, the large community owned by bitcoin has supported the countinue to development of bitcoin expanding and maybe we are just waiting for the time if bitcoin adoption globally will be carried out, I remember when there was another crypto (YFI) that cost more than bitcoin but still people trust bitcoin more as an investment asset and their trust paid off when the crypto market plummeted YFI fell even worse than bitcoin today.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It is very interesting discuss Bitcoin which has always been the King of Cryptocurrency from year to year. The development of bitcoin is much more advanced than the previous year, from its initial appearance it was only considered a joke until it was officially adopted as a legal tender in a country. El Salvador policy of embracing Bitcoin as a legal tender has prompted several other Latin American leaders to indicate that they will follow El Salvador lead. Support from several countries is a significant change for bitcoin reputation on the world stage.<br /><br />Then the question arises, why did the country officially adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender, why the choice was only Bitcoin, even though there are so many other cryptocurrencies that are still in circulation. The answer is because Bitcoin is the King of all existing Cryptocurrencies.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It is also reasonable to believe that bitcoin is heavy and slow, meaning new stuff would always have an easier room to breathe and who would want to take place of bitcoin like that. Bitcoin is so much in trouble when it comes to transaction numbers that we are talking about billions every single day, sure maybe not all are trading, but it moves and that&#039;s what matters.<br /><br />Even the places like SOL which promotes that they can do 65k TPS, fail at 15k and we have seen it happen, it cannot have it right away, it needs to gradually go up to get there not all at once suddenly. This is why I believe that we shouldn&#039;t be shocked to learn no other project could dethrone bitcoin, it would be quite difficult.</div>

Bitcoin.<br /></div>Judging from the picture you uploaded, only bitcoin is the only one that is really able to stay at number one, since 2015 until now, then has a shift from the beginning to the present, but the shift or stay in the sequence is not a guarantee, the coin has increasing price all the time, this image only shows the rank position of the coin.<br /><br />What we can take from the picture, the coins that are ranked in the top 10 do not provide a guarantee regarding the price, therefore the position of bitcoin is still very profitable in the next few years</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It is better to diversify and invest in coins that have remained in the top 3 or 4 positions for a long period of time. If you analyse the market, you will clearly see that it&#039;s bitcoin, ethereum and tether dominating the top. Diversification should be done carefully, after proper research. Or else investing a part of your capital in the wrong coin can result in loss.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Going through the history of cryptocurrency, it is possible to see a list of cryptocurrencies that have been developed and never gained the importance as bitcoin. During the year 1983 itself cryptographic based electronic money ecash developed. Further many more development have been tossed.<br /><br />Finally bitcoin came into existence and used till now. Soon after bitcoin few other cryptocurrencies have got developed. One amongst is the Litecoin and that is still in use. Among the list of cryptocurrencies developed during the days of bitcoin into existence, most have gone out of the market. This too a reason that can be added to state bitcoin is King.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Since bitcoin has always occupied an irreplaceable position, I think it&#039;s all enough to show that no crypto really deserves it other than Bitcoin. At least for me personally Bitcoin will remain king and other crypto looks normal to me. They don&#039;t last long, they will be constantly replaced with new ones or with some trending altcoins. The top 10 cryptocurrencies on CMC are not really trustworthy, see Ethereum as the second position now heading towards PoS and getting more and more centralized by the day. PoW proves bitcoin is where it should be then, now, and forever.</div>
