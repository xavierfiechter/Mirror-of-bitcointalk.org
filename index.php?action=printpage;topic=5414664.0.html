					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">For privacy purposes, it is better to have a wallet that supports “coin control<sup>[1]</sup>” and thus it will ensure that the rest of your addresses will not be known, as for the reason, it is either random to attack the network or someone is trying to collect more data about you, in the end money does not grow on trees and is not distributed One free money.<br /><br /><br />[1] https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015996580-Using-Coin-control</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have been seeing it more and more with larger and larger amounts on some of my long term cold wallets. I figure if I ever move the funds I&#039;ll coin control all of those funds someplace else. <br /><br />At a guess, it is a dust attack for some reason BUT they know that people in order to have more privacy will ignore / leave the truly dust amounts. But make it more money and they may actually move it someplace where they may have be able to trace it.<br /><br />Yeah, I know, sounds paranoid but it&#039;s the only thing I can come up with.<br /><br />-Dave</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I experience one of my addresses with balance but it doesn&#039;t break any privacy because I only receive it in my one address and I include it on my next withdrawal to Binance. <br /><br />I don&#039;t see any effect receiving them if you only receive it only in your one address but if the amount is too small better you manually choose what coin you want to spend because it can affect the transaction size which could lead to a high transaction fee excluding it can save more fees. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414664.msg61002491#msg61002491">Quote from: Ultegra134 on September 24, 2022, 08:53:19 PM</a></div><div class="quote">I&#039;ve had this happen to my Metamask wallet.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I say it was a dust attack there. Someone tries to probe your wallet if you forgot to exclude that dust input into your balance. Use coin control and send that amount back to where it comes from just to spite those cunt. <br />And if I were you, I would recheck or doubt my security cause someone has malicious intent toward you.</div>

The tokens you get on your MetaMask wallet are scams that could potentially execute malicious code when trying to move them.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes this is puzzling. Because why not send a few satoshis instead of sending this large amount. Dust attack are usually common when miner fees are low and usually never in strong bull markets. But they are hoping you just send all your bitcoins from your wallet from all your addresses and your privacy is affected by linking all your wallets and addresses together.<br /><br />Also very common on ETH. But with ETH they send you thousands of some unknown coin. You google where to sell it and it’s some unknown exchange where the coin has high value. Only way to sell is to put in your private seeds and all your coins and tokens are gone, very common scam and many fall for it. </div>
