The zkSNACKs coordinator in Wasabi Wallet 2.0 offers an initial coordinator fee of 0.3% which only fresh coinjoin UTXOs will pay. Remixes,Wasabi Wallet 1.0 coinjoin outputs and UTXOs of 0.01 BTC or less pay no coordinator fees in Wasabi Wallet 2.0 coinjoins.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">nopara is a funny guy. The ETA part was so hilarious when I read it. <br />He is saying that, if everything plays out well, we will see Wasabi Wallet 2.0 in 14 months. The only fact of giving a 3months option a 95% chance of missing the deadline is funny. Good for him he has no boss, try giving those estimates as a Project Manager.&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Of course, but I guess it&#039;s a responsibility for all of us and that should not be demanded to some nicer interface.<br />Bitcoin investors may not recognise its true power, but the impulse behind this computer-generated wonder is revolutionary: to take the production and control of money away from the government. This has tremendous implications for anybody&#039;s wealth preservation.<br />Again, it&#039;s not only like making that technology easy and usable for the masses rather combining that to a meaningful SO WHAT?

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Few days ago Wasabi released TestNet Release of their new wallet with major improvements and you can only test how it works for now.<br />I have to say that interface is much better, but what&#039;s under the hood is more important, because there are not more limitations for Coinjoin.<br />NOTE that this should only be used with <b>testnet</b> coins, and you can report any bugs you find to developers.<br />Download is available for Linux, Mac and WiNd0ws on Wasabi Github page:<br /><br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/lRzO5T8.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/lRzO5T8.jpg</a><br />https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/releases/tag/v1.98.0.0<br /><br />You can get testnet coins from any of this faucets:<br />https://testnet-faucet.mempool.co/<br />https://bitcoinfaucet.uo1.net/<br />https://kuttler.eu/en/bitcoin/btc/faucet/<br />https://testnet-faucet.com/btc-testnet/<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Since UTXOs are public on the blockchain, they are analyzed regardless if zkSNACKs is using the analysis&#039; data or not. This is not an information that the user confidentially shares with anyone. This is public information.<br /><br />&gt; We should use, accept and spend &#039;tainted coins&#039;, because Bitcoin being fungible is one of its most important properties. If you start trying to get &#039;coins without risk of taint&#039;, you&#039;re starting to play after someone&#039;s arbitrarily set rules and not after Bitcoin&#039;s rules.<br /><br />Tainting is the consequence of lack of fungibility. Fungibility is only achieved for coins those come out of Wasabi coinjoins. Fungibility: indistinguishability is achieved on coinjoin outputs, as receivers of coinjoined coins cannot make meaningful differentiation between any two coinjoined coins. What you&#039;re suggesting is a social consensus on &quot;let&#039;s close our eyes and consider every two UTXOs fungible&quot; which I am all for. Unfortunately, we are a minority who understand the value of fungibility and even a smaller minority who are willing to act based on this social consensus. In fact, even if there&#039;s willingness, the real world may force you to not do that anyway, just like in our case, so we must have technical solutions instead.</div>

We can circumvent / fight against this by spinning up more nodes and making it harder for them to keep control of large parts of the network.<br /><br />I do believe that off-chain stuff is easier and faster to implement than changing the Bitcoin protocol.

Governments and centralized exchanges have come up with this notion to try to gain some control over bitcoin, because they can&#039;t possible accept a permissionless currency which they don&#039;t control. There is no definition of what is tainted and what isn&#039;t. What one exchange deems tainted another exchange might deem clean, and vice versa. It is completely arbitrary. The whole functioning of taint as a concept depends on the mass delusion of the community that the need to keep their coins &quot;clean&quot;. If every user of bitcoin stopped using exchanges which enforce this made up nonsense, then taint would disappear overnight. If every user of bitcoin mixed or coinjoined every coin they ever touched, then taint would disappear overnight.<br /><br />So if we tell every newcomer to bitcoin to make sure to only trade on fully KYCed accounts on centralized exchanges and never mix their coins for fear of some faceless third party deeming their coins tainted, then all we do is lend credence to the concept of taint and make centralized control over bitcoin stronger.</div>

It&#039;s mining. Mining is what makes bitcoin perfectly fungible because even when &#039;tainted&#039; bitcoin goes through the process of mining and gets added to the block, at least part of it becomes clean again through transaction fees. To keep the political nonsense of taintness sound convincing, governments and other agencies would have to declare all transaction fees illegal since it is not possible to distinguish between legal and illegal coins once they get laundered through fees. They would have to go further and declare the very process of mining illegal because there is no way to <i>control</i> which coins are being laundered.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg59786202#msg59786202">Quote from: n0nce on April 07, 2022, 09:19:10 AM</a></div><div class="quote">They will also surely give in to those agencies again if pressured and log mappings between inputs and outputs and provide them in case there was potential &#039;illicit activity&#039; detected.<br /></div>They can&#039;t log mappings between inputs and outputs, however, a malicious coordinator can log ties between unrelated inputs (it can learn which inputs belong to the same user), which is also very useful information for three-letter agencies.<br /></div>

Is that due to some government order, is it due to the fact that they feel they&#039;re fighting spam, whatever, you have this drawback. <br /><br />If you don&#039;t care neither about those then it won&#039;t take long until you start living outside society.</div>

Everyone can define taint as they wish. It&#039;s a subjective, arbitrary thing that you can simply choose not to accept. Who gives them the authority to define such a thing as &#039;taint&#039;? The blockchain knows no taint, and we should stick to the blockchain, not some arbitrary group of people trying to convince us of properties that are <i>not</i> written on the blockchain.<br /><br /></div><br />But another problem for the &quot;taint patrol&quot;, how can they distiguish which UTXOs came from &quot;Mr. Heroine Dealer&quot;, and which came from &quot;clean sources&quot;.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br />I could just say for instance, that all UTXOs that are sent to addresses starting with <tt>bc1q666....</tt> are criminal, because they contain evil due to the number 666 or something like this.

We should not treat these &#039;taint definition companies&#039; any different.<br /><br /></div><br />I agree with everything you stand for whole heartedly. But from a practical standpoint for the newbies/ordinary users, would you recommend services that would taint their wallets that might make it hard for them to sell their coins in exchanges?

Depending on who you met, you will get different answers to your questions, as their personality is the exact opposite. zkSNACKs is a company with over 30+ people already and opinions on blacklisting varies to a great degree from &quot;this should&#039;d been done long time ago&quot; to &quot;we must start working on decentralized coordination protocols.&quot; My take is that I&#039;d not like to discriminate between users at all, but it had to be done, and I can only hope it wasn&#039;t already too late.

If I deposit coins into a casino to gamble, and then I withdraw and send Bitcoin from my casino account to a CEX such as Coinbase, those coins will be tainted. What about if I send them to my private wallet first and then to Coinbase? Still tainted? Or I make multiple withdrawals from the casino to different addresses, send them around a bit in my own wallets, consolidate the UTXOs, and finally move them to Coinbase. How many hoops does one have to jump through to get rid of this bullshit taint tag?&nbsp; &nbsp; </div>

You can get into trouble for owning certain coins that someone else has branded as tainted and suspicious. The solution seems so simple. Just avoid these horrible services that do that. In reality, it&#039;s much more difficult than that. They market themselves really good, and you won&#039;t come across decentralized solutions until you get deeper into the problem.

Every exchange has their own set of secret algorithms that decide what is tainted and what isn&#039;t. It is completely arbitrary. Pretty much every bitcoin in active circulation could be tainted if you look back far enough.<br /></div>I believe there was a report about something like 99% of $500 bills having measurable traces of cocaine on them or something like that.. ;D Similar story here, probably. Imagine a store would start scanning every bill and if there&#039;s a sign of cocaine on it, not only refuses to accept the bill, but <b>confiscates</b> it. People would outrage! <br />But Bitcoin investors who have understood nothing about the technology and core principles, just accept such a procedure and get themselves a cash-scanning machine to make sure their paper bills have no such traces.

What if Coinbase accept a coin which Binance thinks is tainted and sweeps it in to their hot wallet. Does that make every withdrawal from Coinbase tainted? Completely arbitrary and completely meaningless.<br /></div>Exactly. I want people to understand that <i>actually, there is no taint</i>. It&#039;s an arbitrary tag that anyone can put on anything, yet in the blockchain world they take any random company&#039;s word as the universal truth and just accept their subjective opinions.

For instance, while so far it seems like the best architecture for a crypto exchange, you can&#039;t build a decentralized p2p tor exchange without a company behind it into an iPhone app, that at the same time has an email login and a customer support in case you forget your password. It&#039;s a bit like PGP: it&#039;s really good, but really non-user friendly. I believe to make things &#039;user friendly&#039; by today&#039;s definition, you have to dumb them down so much that it&#039;s almost impossible to still keep them as secure, decentralized, ... as possible.</div>

You are connecting to a coordinator through Tor, so it won&#039;t know your real IP address. That is not a problem. However, the problem is that all the inputs that you share with a coordinator will come from a single Tor identity, and a coordinator will learn that certain inputs belong to the same user. Inputs may not be connected to each other on the blockchain (publicly available information) but can be linked to each other during input consolidation (information unknown to the public). For instance, if one of your inputs is KYCed (tied to real identity) and the others are in a blacklist, then a coordinator or blockchain surveillance firm will learn to whom blacklisted coins belong. </div>

Although, it isn&#039;t so simple to comprehend at first sight, the two parties can hide their outputs (hence why &quot;blinded outputs&quot;) using blind signature (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_signature).

The next simplest implementation is where the users send their input and output information to some meeting point server, and the server creates the transaction and asks people to sign it. The server learns the mapping, but no one else does, and the server still can&#039;t steal the coins.<br /><br />More complicated implementations are possible where even the server doesn&#039;t learn the mapping.<br /><br />E.g. Using chaum blind signatures: The users connect and provide inputs (and change addresses) and a cryptographically-blinded version of the address they want their private coins to go to; the server signs the tokens and returns them. The users anonymously reconnect, unblind their output addresses, and return them to the server. The server can see that all the outputs were signed by it and so all the outputs had to come from valid participants.

In fact this is the only sybil attack that as far as I know is feasible to do, although it&#039;d still be noticeable and it&#039;s still not a cheap attack. The coordinator has to provide hundreds of inputs and outputs (equivalent to hundreds of normal bitcoin transactions) to deanonymize a single UTXO. In fact double that cost as the attacker must prepare the UTXOs in advance by making transactions. Furthermore, it&#039;s also detectable by looking at the remixes in the coinjoin. If the remix ratio is different from other coinjoins then we would know the attack happened. You might think then the attacker should spend more money on fees to pre-mix coins to make the remix ratio perfect. But even then there would be a pattern with the timing of the pre-mixes that would clearly differ from normal coinjoin volume. Executing such attack in an unnoticeable fashion would cost an extraordinary amount of resources since to hide all the patterns the attack would have to keep participating in every single coinjoin with many inputs until the target UTXO would decide to mix so the attack can be cleanly executed.<br /><br />This has nothing to do with blockchain analysis tho.</div>

In other words they have no understanding of the technology, they don&#039;t care about financial sovereignty, they don&#039;t want decentralization, etc. they just want to make money.

Their focus is on <i>everybody&#039;s privacy</i>, not on yours nor on mine nor on theirs, but everyone&#039;s.<br /><br />If they&#039;re threatened to not be private, while that&#039;s the only principle they follow since the development of Wasabi, what do you think it&#039;s reasonable thing to do? Besides, there wasn&#039;t such pressure. Nobody forced them do nothing. This happened voluntarily, which shows that the fish stinks from the head. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If some of you ever used Wasabi wallet and then you want to send Bitcoin to Gemini exchange, you should think again about it.<br />I saw one user on reddit posting screenshot of email from Gemini support asking him to refrain from using Wasabi or mixers, and they are asking him for documentation evidence for source of his coins, with information about his salary, proof from his employer, link for his profile, bank statements, certificates, signed letters from lawyer, inheritance... &nbsp;::)<br />I think it&#039;s borderline crazy to ask your customer to send you all this crap and more... but I guess we live in a crazy world, and we shouldn&#039;t use or depend on centralized exchanges at all.<br />https://www.reddit.com/r/Gemini/comments/usvlny/just_received_a_disturbing_requestemail_from/</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just read many posts I have missed and I have to say one thing.&nbsp; If you claim you strongly support privacy and your user base is mostly composed of privacy geeks, if you turn your back to all the things you claimed and suddenly agree to work with whoever to debunk transactions then your goals are definitely not strongly supporting privacy and offering your users a way to be more private on the Bitcoin Blockchain.<br /><br />If I was nopara, I would have let Wasabi die.&nbsp; I would have let everyone down or whatever but never would I have agreed to apply procedures and collaborate with parties that are against the ideas Wasabi began from.&nbsp; I see this situation closely resembling Google&#039;s sudden action of changing their &#039;Don&#039;t Do Evil&#039; motto.&nbsp; No matter how silent that change of motto was, it spoke and still speaks VERY loudly.<br /><br />I understand there is a reputation at stake.&nbsp; I understand they would become the enemy of the Government, and that probably nopara and the other developers have been so far living off Wasabi.&nbsp; But as I previously said, if my intention was to offer users privacy, no way in hell would I accept to collaborate with the entity they are trying to cover themselves up from.&nbsp; I thought by creating Wasabi there were some risks nopara and everyone else had to assume.&nbsp; One of them is the Government conspiring against them.<br /><br />Sure, information about my transaction is public.&nbsp; There is probably a TON of data that can be used to determine with a pretty high accuracy certain information about my transaction such as origin, even after a Coin Join.&nbsp; But only by denying these regulations and invasive procedures can we at least try to put an end to all of it.&nbsp; If I stop using Binance as an Exchange, Electrum as a Wallet, Ledger as a Closed Source Hardware Wallet, Windows as an Operating System, now Wasabi as a privacy focused Exchange et cetera, the amount of information collected about us becomes much, much lower.&nbsp; And without enough information, there is no point in doing Blockchain Analysis.&nbsp; And if Blockchain Analysis companies do not have collaborators, their existence is once again worthless.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60179310#msg60179310">Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on May 20, 2022, 07:49:49 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Jesus, this whole thread reminds me why I don&#039;t use Reddit.

Those who are accumulating and buy more in dips never make a noise when price drops. Only the weak hands who had no understanding of bitcoin and wanted to become rich overnight keep creating topics everywhere about &quot;why has price dropped&quot;. In this case you can&#039;t make the conclusion that everyone bitcoiner is hoping to &quot;get rich quick&quot; just because all you see on the internet is such subjects.</div>

Here&#039;s the thing though. It almost certainly already is happening in your country, but it&#039;s just people you don&#039;t agree with being censored so you don&#039;t notice or care. Are you <i>certain</i> that your government will <i>always</i> treat your fairly? What about <i>all future governments</i>? You really can&#039;t imagine <i>any</i> circumstance in which your government might not like something you have to say? As we&#039;ve seen throughout history, by the time they&#039;ve silenced all the outspoken critics and start coming for the average citizens, then it is far too late to do anything.<br /><br />I often mentally draw a parallel between this forum and bitcoin itself. There are a minority of users on this forum who express opinions which are provably wrong and/or abhorrent. Despite this, I have never and would never try to have their posts deleted or ban them from posting here just because of the nature of their opinions. There are a minority of users of bitcoin who use bitcoin for acts I would deem immoral. I have never and would never try to have them excluded from using bitcoin. Bitcoin is either censorship resistant, or it isn&#039;t. You cannot pick and choose who it is censorship resistant for.<br /></div><br />Again: Bitcoin is either censorship resistant, or it isn&#039;t. You cannot pick and choose who it is censorship resistant for. If you, like Wasabi, start censoring some users, then you open the door to censoring anybody and everybody, and that includes you. Saying that you accept censorship of some users is saying that you intend to live a life so meek and unassuming that you will forever comply with literally anything your government (or some other country&#039;s government, or some faceless organization like Chainalysis) decides and never once even so much as think about stepping out of line or holding a slightly controversial view, and therefore never risk being censored yourself. It&#039;s saying that you are willing to open up your entire life to total scrutiny by unknown third parties to ensure that you behaving like the good little citizen they want you to be.<br /><br />Being pro-censorship is being anti-privacy, anti-bitcoin, and anti-freedom. The sooner we all abandon pro-censorship services the better.</div>

I personally agree with some of your points, but in trying to understand the standpoint of WasabiWallet, I also believe that what they are doing is a necessary trade-off for a segment of users in Bitcoin Land. Let&#039;s leave the users/community to decide if they actually think Wasabi is good for their own usage of Bitcoin. <br /><br />nopara73, where can we get the data for Wasabi&#039;s usage before, and after the update?</div>

Let&#039;s leave the users/community to decide if they actually think Wasabi is good for their own usage of Bitcoin. <br /></div>In my last post in this topic, I quoted your multiple mentions of &#039;tradeoffs&#039; and ask how you come to the conclusions that those are actually viable tradeoffs. You mentioned it again, so I would really like to know &#039;what&#039;s in it for the user&#039; (since otherwise it&#039;s not what you say it is).<br />Sure, of course everyone has to decide for themselves which services to use or not to use, but it&#039;s great to have this discussion since interesting points come up that someone might not have considered yet.<br /><br />Honestly, by now I&#039;m convinced that Wasabi&#039;s decision was purely financially motivated and has no signs of &#039;tradeoff for a segment of users&#039; or anything like that. There&#039;s basically nothing in it for the users. They are deluded by numerous privacy claims, influencer marketing and ads to pay money which is then used to deanonymize and discriminate against them. Pretty predatory type of business.<br /><br />@dkbit, I also have some BTC on an exchange that asked for KYC to withdraw and just forgot about it. Now you reminded me of it again. ;) It was just a small test amount. Even back then I fortunately already followed the rule to try everything with small amounts first before doing larger deposits. Some exchanges circumvent this by only requiring ID for amounts above a threshold and letting anything below through without KYC, so it&#039;s not a guaranteed winning strategy.</div>

Not to speak that as soon as the anonymity pool shrinks, traceability increases and the quality of the product plummets.<br /></div>Isn&#039;t that kind of absurd?<br />~snip~<br /></div>I do think so, yes. A privacy / mixing tool is nothing without a large user base. That&#039;s also why starting such a project is pretty difficult; because in the beginning, people get very little privacy benefit from using it. So in my opinion, no matter how many institutional investors they attract; the product will fail if it has no users.</div>

I even colored, bolded and underlined it. <br />It&#039;s how Bitcoin was always meant to be: peer to peer and decentralized. You trade your BTC directly with another person through a decentralized exchange, which is just a piece of software running locally on your computer; no servers, companies or accounts involved. Funds are in multisig and released if the payment goes through cleanly. It all runs over Tor and there&#039;s no central authority to bribe, censor or shut down.<br /><br />It&#039;s as close as you can get to a pure in-person P2P trade, when it comes to censorship resistance, privacy and anonymity, while still being online and convenient to use.</div>

There are no servers; just your machine and the other people&#039;s machines and they communicate directly with each other through Tor.<br />The rates are whatever people put up as offers; there are &#039;market value&#039; offers, fixed price offers and offers that are a certain percentage above or below market.<br /><br />You can see all of that in the program or on a website they host: https://bisq.markets/<br /><br />For payment methods, in Europe I see mostly orders with direct bank transfer, but also other popular options exist.<br />Who pays more depends; I can only speak for Bitcoin - in that case, small orders are more expensive than on exchanges (I guess it makes sense due to the work someone has to put in to set up 10 or 20 &#039;$100BTC&#039; offers).<br /><br />But it can be cheaper when buying more; also do remember that there are no withdrawal fees. If you buy $100 of BTC and pay $20 in withdrawal fee, it&#039;s much more expensive than taking a &#039;1% above market value&#039; Bisq offer. Not to speak of the &#039;price for privacy&#039; - an exchange will chew through your identity, get whatever they can and sell it to the highest bidder. And of course the cost of lost funds if for whatever reason an exchange decides you&#039;re a criminal. All these costs don&#039;t exist on Bisq.</div>

Note that the account nopara73 belongs to Adam Ficsor, the CEO of Wasabi. His responses are quite telling, and reveal a lot about how Wasabi view their customers now. Other key statements:<br /><br />Adam Ficsor said this on Telegram.<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">We&#039;ll have to hire a bc anal company and filter out coinjoin input registrations with them</div><br />Max Hillebrand (CEO of zkSNACKs) said this in an interview.<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: <a class="ul" href="https://stephanlivera.com/episode/364/">https://stephanlivera.com/episode/364/</a></div><div class="quote">if you, as a CoinJoin coordinator, if you want to work with institutional clients, hedge funds, insurance funds, Michael Saylor, and all these people, well, even if ZKSnacks were not to be regulated, those customers might very well be, maybe because they’re custodians of other people’s money or whatnot. And then these regulated entities can only become users of a coordinator—arguably, I’m not sure—if such a blacklisting is involved.</div><br />In short, Wasabi now cooperate with blockchain analysis to spy on and censor their users so they can cater to institutional clients so they can maximize their own profits. <br /><br /><hr /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60333741#msg60333741">Quote from: PrivacyG on June 11, 2022, 09:55:51 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Is it that you are running low on clients after we all left due to the new surveillance features of the wallet or is it that your Blockchain Analysis collaborator needs more clients to spy on?</div>Perhaps spying on their users and sharing this data is even more lucrative than their blockchain analysis partners originally thought, and so they are happy to bank roll a signature campaign to harvest even more data.</div>

The launch of the campaign has been postponed at least 3 or 4 times due to the fact that it had to be timed with the release of Wasabi 2.0, the release of which was repeatedly postponed for one reason or another.<br /><br />And while I may not be as tech-savvy as you, I still think that Adam just decided to look into the future, thereby taking care of an impeccable reputation now (after all, we live in the real world). In addition, I still consider launching a campaign the right decision, if only for the reason that the forum needs some kind of advertising variety (in the context of the unprecedented advertising superiority of bookmakers).</div>

At first sight I thought that between the lines, it tries to convey that they&#039;re forced to do this and see it as a kind of &#039;death&#039; of their project. But as they later defended their move on the web (saying they&#039;re doing it voluntarily) and on this forum through nopara73, it doesn&#039;t seem like they were &#039;forced to kill their dream project&#039; or something like this.

If you think of participants as independent inputs registering for a transaction, then yes, we can say that some participants will not end up being so after actual blacklisting occurs. If by participants you imply users who control one or more inputs, then it is only partially correct because &quot;legal&quot; inputs will still get past &quot;censors.&quot;<br /><br />It is claimed in the statement you quoted that a coordinator can&#039;t breach the privacy of participants, but this is also only partially true. While a coordinator can&#039;t see which inputs correspond to which outputs, he can see which inputs belong to a particular Tor-identity (person), information that is not available to public and can be sold to a chain surveillance company.</div>

For pretty much everyone that single coordinator is owned and operator by zkSNACKs, and that is the coordinator which is now spying on people and blacklisting inputs. The coordinator is responsible for collating all the coinjoin inputs, creating the necessary transactions, collecting signatures, and so on.<br /><br />Anyone else in the world can spin up their own coordinator if they wanted, but there are two main issues with that. Firstly, the liquidity on your coordinator depends on how many users connect to it. If no one else connects to your coordinator, then you have no one to coinjoin with. Secondly, your coordinator is still centralized. It might be owned and operated by someone other than zkSNACKs, but it is still owned and operated by a single entity.<br /><br />It would take a redesign of Wasabi to implement a decentralized coinjoin, such that every user effectively runs their own coordinator which then communicates with everyone else&#039;s coordinator. Given that this is never going to happen, then the better option is to switch to JoinMarket instead, which does pretty much this, and communicates directly with other JoinMarket clients peer to peer rather than via a centralized coordinator.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A thread worth reading for those who are still considering using Wasabi Wallet 2.0 to mix their transactions: https://twitter.com/mHaGqnOACyFm0h5/status/1536442355003293700<br /><br />A former lead Wasabi developer disclosed some serious vulnerabilities that current Wasabi 2.0 client allegedly has:<br /><br />&gt; &quot;if your threat model includes making or receiving payments that must not be linkable with other payments under any circumstances, there&#039;s a good chance they will be linked on the input side by auto coinjoin, with no recourse. no control over this. in other words although in principle the toxic change problem is no longer inherent to the protocol, and the client could have eliminated it, it chooses not to for no discernible reason.<br /><br />&gt; &quot;the protocol is basically unfinished, containing numerous vectors for performing targeted attacks on specific coins with deniability or completely covertly.&quot;<br /><br />&gt; &quot;temporal fingerprints are not taken into consideration, though several exist even without assuming an adverserial coordinator.&quot;<br /><br />&gt; &quot;multiple perverse incentives are also provided. for example, you can just modify the client to never pay any coordination fees. if transactions are full, users race each other to register their last inputs, an incentive for yet more temporal privacy leaks on input side.&quot;<br /><br />&gt; &quot;the claimed &quot;orders of magnitude&quot; (i.e. at least 100x) more efficient transactions is dubious at best given the tendency for fragmentation. to mitigate this, various ad-hoc rules have been added to fudge things.&quot;<br /><br />&gt; &quot;the new CEO is aware of these problems, having discussed them with me extensively in private before and after i left. don&#039;t believe his lies.&quot;<br /><br /><br />I also found the following article which briefly explains what automatic coinjoins are: https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/05/wasabi-wallet-20-will-offer-automatic-coinjoins-by-default-to-boost-privacy/</div>

Secondly, your coordinator is still centralized. It might be owned and operated by someone other than zkSNACKs, but it is still owned and operated by a single entity.<br /><br />It would take a redesign of Wasabi to implement a decentralized coinjoin, such that every user effectively runs their own coordinator which then communicates with everyone else&#039;s coordinator. Given that this is never going to happen, then the better option is to switch to JoinMarket instead, which does pretty much this, and communicates directly with other JoinMarket clients peer to peer rather than via a centralized coordinator.<br /></div><br /><hr /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60367498#msg60367498">Quote from: NotATether on June 15, 2022, 03:15:37 PM</a></div><div class="quote"><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60362232#msg60362232">Quote from: n0nce on June 15, 2022, 12:26:04 AM</a></div><div class="quote">[4] Hideous download numbers since this debacle (~10x lower than before).<br /><span style="font-size: 7pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;">[4] https://tooomm.github.io/github-release-stats/?username=zkSNACKs&amp;repository=WalletWasabi</span><br /></div><br />Note that this only counts downloads from the Github Releases page, and Wasabi Wallet can move the binaries to their own website at any time to hide the download stats, say if they didn&#039;t want them to be used against them in the news.<br /></div>Sure; but for now we do have the information.

At that point I don&#039;t even know why people read that stuff if they can just read the adverts on the company webpage. What&#039;s the point of a journalist that just repeats company claims without scrutiny? I digress - let&#039;s stay on topic. ;)</div>

Pathetic.<br /><br />The paragraphs above the ones you&#039;ve quoted are quite revealing too. Things that Wasabi will censor you for include (but are by no means limited to) anything infringing on copyright laws, anything related to scams, and anything sexual. Who gets to decide on that? We don&#039;t know, because again they hide behind the words &quot;contracted third party&quot; instead of being honest and naming a specific blockchain analysis firm. CSW has copyrighted the whitepaper in some jurisdictions. Will Wasabi censor me if I try to pay for my hosting of the whitepaper? Some people think bitcoin is a scam and some banks stop people from buying bitcoin. Now Wasabi is doing the same thing to bitcoin users? And regardless of your personal views on porn, it is perfectly legal in most jurisdictions and yet still Wasabi are censoring it. What about if I want to buy some lingerie for <del>Foxpup</del> my wife? Is that censored too? How long before other perfectly legal things like gambling show up on that list too?<br /><br />And of course all this is buried in legal documents that 99% of users won&#039;t read. The Privacy Policy link on their main page helpfully leads to a 404. And still absolutely no mention anywhere on their main site, but plenty of blatantly false and contradictory statements such as:<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">What you do with your bitcoin is your business.</div>Unless it&#039;s something we don&#039;t like. ::)<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">The wallet uses WabiSabi, an anonymous credential scheme that was designed to enable more accessible and efficient coinjoins.</div>So accessible that we prevent people form accessing it. ::)</div>

If <i>someone</i> can be censored, then <i>you</i> can be censored.

This is what Wasabi have created here. <br /><br />The list of things they have admitted they will censor for is bad enough.

Why would reporting an illegal transaction to Wasabi achieve anything at all, unless they have the ability to track those coins and are going to share that information with law enforcement?<br /></div>

In this case you are not permitted to use the relevant/high-risk bitcoin UTXO to reach the coinjoin services.<br /><br />You acknowledge that zkSNACKs Ltd.&#039;s decision to take certain actions, including suspending for any reason at our sole discretion, may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to zkSNACKs Ltd.&#039;s risk management and security protocols. You agree that zkSNACKs Ltd. is under no obligation to disclose the details of its risk management and security procedures to you.<br /><br /><b>Your access with the relevant bitcoin UTXOs to the coinjoin services will be permanently suspended.</b></div>https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/master/WalletWasabi/Legal/Assets/LegalDocumentsWw2.txt<br /><br />I guess that still doesn&#039;t mean that those UTXOs would also be blacklisted on centralized exchanges, but the chances of that happening are surely greater. Each CEX can have their own algorithms and methods to determine what is taint to them. That&#039;s why all this nonsense is so dangerous. Depositing to one CEX might get your coins and account frozen, but doing the same on a different CEX might work without any problems. The simplest solution, don&#039;t use any of them. </div>

Everything they have done over the last few months has been designed to shift their target audience away from regular people and towards large institutions. They only care about regular users insofar as they provide liquidity to institutions looking to coinjoin.<br /><br />If the average user loses privacy because they can&#039;t select specific UTXOs, too bad.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It seems Wasabi software doesn&#039;t prevent users from merging the outputs that came from the same CoinJoin round, which essentially destroys all privacy gained as a result of a complex transaction.<br /><br />Let&#039;s analyze a bit the first CoinJoin transaction: https://kycp.org/#/d31c2b4d71eb143b23bb87919dda7fdfecee337ffa1468d1c431ece37698f918<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://i.gyazo.com/58a65b1e90089d647e655b608ea5c48f.png">https://i.gyazo.com/58a65b1e90089d647e655b608ea5c48f.png</a><br /><br />In the picture above, we clearly see that some of the outputs have been spent together in four separate transactions:<br /><br />https://kycp.org/#/3c67a57d35176bb13a7f098295a51ceb7a9abccc9b655cf2582126f0d1a05b0f<br />https://kycp.org/#/50cbcba0b4d752c658069842202e200c3086d3c7bd2258363103ccf40614866d<br />https://kycp.org/#/cb5816fa97cf8826548524f9e02290a7764ad2a9857c1abde2fd44c55516ece0<br />https://kycp.org/#/b0f590341a587fe6140a932d81c238a7a0451ccfde4efec7084f1c5dda8e0561<br /><br />The second transaction (50cbcba0b4d) is (surprisingly) also the second wasabi 2.0 coinjoin, which was announced here https://twitter.com/HillebrandMax/status/1538181219610918913?s=20&amp;t=qOdxv6VZZyiopkWGbZKwoQ<br /><br /><a href="https://i.gyazo.com/ac7c278f9d8e095655a03ffc8b461884.png">https://i.gyazo.com/ac7c278f9d8e095655a03ffc8b461884.png</a><br /><br />This particular transaction indicates that some of the outputs of the first coinjoin were used as inputs in the second coinjoin, which is totally fine from the privacy perspective because they may belong to different users.<br /><br />The third (cb5816fa97c) and the fourth (b0f590341a5) transactions are either consolidations or payments (although without creating any change outputs).<br /><br />The most interesting transaction (in my opinion) is the first one (3c67a57d351):<br /><br /><a href="https://i.gyazo.com/502db2b2f13fb548f450130751e06271.png">https://i.gyazo.com/502db2b2f13fb548f450130751e06271.png</a><br /><br />The output of this transaction (according to KYCP) belongs to OKEX exchange, which means that all these inputs were sent directly to someone&#039;s exchange account and, therefore, can be linked to a particular identity. Wasabi Wallet doesn&#039;t utilize any post-mix spending tools, and if part of the users practices bad spending behavior (like spending directly to a centralized exchange), then the other part of the users (more advanced) can potentially be deanonymized in a process of elimination.</div>

They don&#039;t care if the average user suffers, as has become blatantly clear by them spying on and censoring said users.<br /></div>Of course, auto-coinjoin also means they can boast about high CoinJoin numbers to investors, even though people don&#039;t even use the wallet and let the funds sit in there without user action.<br /><br />I must say, the poor community support on Twitter and low GitHub download numbers give me the impression their actual real userbase (and thus anonymity set) may be pretty small.<br /></div><br />It seems pretty short sighted of them to pursue this business model, in my opinion. &nbsp;If they have a large amount of liquidity in their coinjoins, but only a handful of large institutional clients anonymity is going to be nearly impossible, and even privacy will become harder and harder to achieve.<br /><hr /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60388242#msg60388242">Quote from: n0nce on June 18, 2022, 10:48:22 AM</a></div><div class="quote">For full transparency: icopress contacted me and he kindly offered me to send him a concise list of questions which he&#039;d directly forward to the Wasabi CEO. <br />I&#039;m partly speculating myself in this thread, but also gave Wasabi the benefit of the doubt in some cases and generally try to be as objective as I can.

Such people are usually considered a serious menace to the government&#039;s stability and even the existence thereof, which is why law enforcement is trying to catch you, tirelessly spying on all your transactions. They may know that some UTXOs belong to your wallet (donations, bitcoin ATM withdrawals, etc.), and they will track these specific payments. You obviously can&#039;t tolerate such an invasion of your privacy, which is why you want to obfuscate all your transactions using the Wasabi 2.0 Awesome CoinJoin Tool. You send all your &quot;tainted&quot; UTXOs to your Wasabi Wallet to prepare them for a CoinJoin transaction. Please note that you send them carefully, one by one, just because it is a good privacy-preserving practice. Even though law enforcement may already know that those outputs belong to you, you don&#039;t want to make their life easier by confirming that once again. The problem with Wasabi Wallet is that it doesn&#039;t allow you to manually select outputs for a CoinJoin, which may well result in merging them on the input side. Yes, the zkSNACKs coordinator won&#039;t know that these inputs belong to the same user, but law enforcement will confirm their suspicions. The very algorithm according to which the Wasabi Wallet works may ruin your privacy by nullifying all your previous privacy-preserving actions.<br /><br />But wait, should we really care what happens on the input side if the goal of a CoinJoin transaction is to obfuscate the link between your past and future transactions? Your future is what matters. The problem with CoinJoin is that it does not magically hide the connection between transactions but merely obfuscates it temporarily. Other users with whom you participated in the CoinJoin transactions may not be so careful privacy-wise as you, they may deanonymize themselves gradually by undergoing KYC procedures, for example.<br /><br />Eventually, all users will be deanonymized because law enforcement has an unlimited amount of time to analyze the transaction. If, however, there are some additional post-mix spending tools in a wallet, which help users further obfuscate the links, the blockchain analysis may take forever. The Wasabi wallet doesn&#039;t care what people do after a CoinJoin, but, for some unknown reason, it thinks it knows better than people what to do before a CoinJoin.</div>

For Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (8GB) will there be assembly or the device does not meet the technical requirements? Installing deb package didn&#039;t work...<br />2. Is the local copy of the blockchain a &quot;cut&quot; version of the blockchain? The size hints at this, but I would like to understand exactly?<br />3. Wallet localization. Where is she set up?&nbsp; The installation package contains folders with localization, but I did not find the wallet localization settings in the settings...<br />4. GeoIP in the tor client - for what purposes? I can only assume - in order to &quot;avoid&quot; TOR nodes in some locations. How about really?<br />5.

Therefore I thoroughly read everything you guys are writing and will summarize a list with the &#039;top questions&#039;.. :)<br /></div><br />Alright, everybody; I&#039;m publishing here a list of 24 questions that was sent to Wasabi CEO (I&#039;m actually not 100% who that currently is). It took me a few hours to go through most of the pages in this thread and summarize all of the &#039;core issues&#039; and questions that came up. It still got pretty long, and I believe if we get answers to all of these, the answers will also explain other questions that did not make the list. I also told icopress that they don&#039;t have to answer everything; but that the whole list will be published, so afterwards we know what was answered and what wasn&#039;t.

Due to the recent changes, we must assume it&#039;s people who are interested in mixing coins, while at the same time not having a problem with the mixer discriminating between UTXOs. Mixing with a blacklist seems like an oxymoron to us and we struggle to see the use case.</li><li> Related to point 1, we found comments on your own Twitter profile from presumably former Wasabi users, like: <div class="quoteheader">Quote from: <a class="ul" href="https://twitter.com/vryfokkenou/status/1503484457029976066">https://twitter.com/vryfokkenou/status/1503484457029976066</a></div><div class="quote">What&#039;s the point of a washing machine that only washes clean laundry?</div> - do you have a response for that?<br /></li><li> Is it correct that you now officially focus on institutional investors and chose to implement a blacklist for this reason? Your blog post and other statements make it seem like this is the case. For example in this interview: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/364/, Max Hillebrand said: &#039;if you, as a CoinJoin coordinator, if you want to work with institutional clients, hedge funds, insurance funds, Michael Saylor, and all these people, well, even if ZKSnacks were not to be regulated, those customers might very well be, maybe because they&#039;re custodians of other people&#039;s money or whatnot.

Would you confirm this? Actually, later you admit that LN has better privacy, so this already seems like a contradiction.<br /></li><li> We&#039;re talking about political refugees, government critics and investigative journalists for example; these are amongst the ones needing privacy the most (and therefore switching to Bitcoin in the first place). But in https://twitter.com/HillebrandMax/status/1537503087987937283, at 1:32:10, Aviv Milner says that &#039;the average person who&#039;s using the product especially if you&#039;re not in a situation where you&#039;re your life depends on it and there&#039;s a large government organization that&#039;s well funded that&#039;s looking to to find you and hunt you down if you&#039;re not in that extreme situation then wasabi provides an incredible amount of privacy&#039;. So it means WasabiWallet is not the &#039;ultimate privacy solution&#039; for Bitcoin after all; just maybe for &#039;getting a little privacy&#039; or how should we call that? Someone who really, really needs actual privacy cannot rely on Wasabi then? What should they use in your opinion? On one hand, you say Wasabi is the only / best option for privacy, but then admit it doesn&#039;t provide enough privacy if someone&#039;s life depends on it; so what&#039;s the point of it all then? We don&#039;t believe privacy is something quantifiable; it&#039;s more a yes-or-no kind of deal. Either your UTXOs and transactions are private or they&#039;re not.</li><li> We noticed your download numbers have almost collapsed since the blacklisting announcement; did you expect this and how does this reflect on the anonymity set? https://tooomm.github.io/github-release-stats/?username=zkSNACKs&amp;repository=WalletWasabi</li><li> Are there any insights on how you blacklist? Do you rely solely on the data from Chainalysis or do you pre- and / or post-process the data? Since we assume blacklists are used to block coins from illegal origins; which laws or rules are used to determine if an origin or past activity is legal or not? Since Bitcoin is a global currency tied to no nation in particular, it appears impossible to declare &#039;legality&#039; in this context. For example, copyright laws differ widely across the world; or when it comes to anything sexual, some stuff is illegal in certain countries, but totally legal in others. How can a legal ground be found to determine which UTXOs are &#039;good&#039; and which are prohibited?</li><li> Are all UTXOs sent to Chainalysis for inspection, whenever someone wants to do a CoinJoin or only if after some pre-filtering you have some suspicion?</li><li> Let&#039;s take an example: An investigative journalist uncovered a government or other wealthy entity&#039;s dirty secrets and now they&#039;re after them. People want to donate to the whistleblower or they want to spend their donations through WasabiWallet. However you get a notice to block those UTXOs, so you do exactly that; isn&#039;t this exactly the target audience? Isn&#039;t this exactly the person who needs a Bitcoin privacy solution? (This refers back to point 1). Don&#039;t you also go straight against Bitcoin&#039;s original goal of pseudonymous, fungible currency that can be received from and sent to anyone, anywhere, anytime? What&#039;s the use of a privacy solution if the ones needing privacy are not allowed to use it? (this refers back to point 2)</li><li> We believe that starting censoring some users opens the door to censoring anybody and everybody. Would you agree with this? <div class="quoteheader">Quote from: <a class="ul" href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60219453#msg60219453">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60219453#msg60219453</a></div><div class="quote">Again: Bitcoin is either censorship resistant, or it isn&#039;t. You cannot pick and choose who it is censorship resistant for. If you, like Wasabi, start censoring some users, then you open the door to censoring anybody and everybody</div></li><li> Let&#039;s take a step back to the beginnings. Did you consider building something decentralized instead of the current coordinator model? As we can see now, it created a central point of failure.</li><li> You already said this isn&#039;t the case; so you don&#039;t have to confirm or deny if this happened; but if we&#039;re being skeptic, we have to consider the idea that you were pressured by authorities after all, with an extra clause that you&#039;re not allowed to say anything about it. Did you ever consider that a privacy-enhancing service would sooner or later be targeted and pressured by authorities? Other similar services explicitly made sure from the beginning that the creators and developers are anonymous, pseudonymous or generally unknown, to make sure such pressure can&#039;t be exterted on the project. Actually, satoshi himself may have left Bitcoin to remove such a central point of failure (through pressure on the creator).</li><li> Did you pay for this post? https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/wasabi-wallet-2-contains-new-features-for-optimizing-bitcoin-coinjoins We wonder how it completely ignores the blacklisting update, given the generally bad reception by the (vocal, even on Twitter) community. There is no mention of collaboration between WasabiWallet and blockchain analysis companies.</li><li> Another question quoted directly from the community: <div class="quoteheader">Quote from: <a class="ul" href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60374195#msg60374195">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60374195#msg60374195</a></div><div class="quote">I&#039;m also interested in the scenario (which will definitely happen sooner or later) where someone is allowed to mix their coins and then afterwards Wasabi decide that their inputs were tainted and they shouldn&#039;t have been allowed to mix them at all, since the document linked to above also invites you to inform them of any illegal transactions and states that they will fully cooperate with any investigations. Why would reporting an illegal transaction to Wasabi achieve anything at all, unless they have the ability to track those coins and are going to share that information with law enforcement?</div></li><li> Automatic CoinJoin and the removal of manual UTXO selection altogether is a deal-breaker for some users (especially in the context of the whole update). We believe it&#039;s unexpected behaviour of a wallet to automatically (without user opt-in) send all of a user&#039;s UTXOs to a blockchain analysis company for vetting (whether blacklisted or not) and afterwards be mixed. Some users are worried that the very act of mixing makes the UTXO &#039;tainted&#039; in the eyes of the exchange and that it will freeze those funds. By the way: this is exactly what you predicted in your old docs pages; if everyone starts coming up with &#039;taint definitions&#039; and blacklists, using (moving) Bitcoin will become infeasibly cumbersome.</li><li> Another quote from the same recent Twitter group chat: https://twitter.com/HillebrandMax/status/1537503087987937283 (at 1:32:40) - Aviv Milner says that &#039;Maybe there is a little more privacy in Lightning&#039;; and elaborates that LN is tricky to use though, so he implies that Wasabi is actually less anonymous / less private than Lightning, but just easier to use? Would you confirm that, that Wasabi CoinJoin privacy is lower than Lightning privacy? So if I need the absolute most privacy, you would recommend to create a Lightning channel and / or doing a submarine swap instead of doing a WasabiWallet CoinJoin? This is practical, important information for a lot of users who need as strong privacy guarantees as possible.</li><li> Right before, he also says that it&#039;s much more private than the vast majority of alternatives; what are those alternative privacy solutions that are much worse than WasabiWallet? Or did he talk about the &#039;alternatives&#039; as non-privacy-promising, plain and normal non-custodial wallets, with no CoinJoin implementation in them; that these are less private?</li><li> For the last point, we have an important observation: <div class="quoteheader">Quote from: <a class="ul" href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60395578#msg60395578">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60395578#msg60395578</a></div><div class="quote">Wasabi Wallet doesn&#039;t utilize any post-mix spending tools, and if part of the users practices bad spending behavior (like spending directly to a centralized exchange), then the other part of the users (more advanced) can potentially be deanonymized in a process of elimination.</div> If I recall correctly, this is also a potential issue / attack on other such mixing technologies; where bad behaviour (unintentional or even intentional) can put the privacy of other users at risk. This sounds like a loophole / security issue just looking to be exploited. Would you confirm this issues and if yes, are there any plans yet to improve this?<br /></li></ul></div>

This means that in my opinion this is not an unacceptable solution. I am sure, as in real life - fiat life, there are scammers who, for example, in an online store, can use fraudulent schemes to get money from not very attentive users. if a similar unified system of blocking transactions on cards that were marked as fraudulent worked in the banking sector, and transactions on them required manual intervention, knowing how many people had already complained about this card or cardholder, the number of such operations would decrease significantly.

For example, at the moment, for myself, I don’t see where I would need mega-anonymity. Well, honestly!

This is of course humor, but very close to reality.<br /></div>What risks, though? Do you believe that Wasabi&#039;s blacklist gets someone his coins back who was scammed? Because that&#039;s absolutely not what&#039;s going on here.. There is no way to reverse a Bitcoin transaction; no matter if you have a blacklist or not. You could make the coins unspendable, if there were a single globally accepted blacklist; but that doesn&#039;t and will never exist.<br /><br />This is one of the core issues: Imagine a world, where American exchanges and services blacklist Russian users; Russian services blacklist American and European users. Then a CEO that is part of one political movement decides that people who follow the opposite political movement are terrorists and blacklists their funds... I could go on and on about this forever. That&#039;s what we call &#039;non-fungibility&#039;. If fungibility, i.e. every coin being equal to any other coin of the same amount, is not given, the whole thing is unusable and pointless. This makes blacklists a direct attack against the usability and as such also on the entirety, of Bitcoin itself.<br /><br />Since you are so keen on the &#039;I have nothing to hide&#039; narrative; why are you interested in a &#039;privacy wallet&#039; in the first place? And why don&#039;t you post your full name, ID and address on the forum? <sup>( -- rhetorical question, please do not do it -- )</sup></div>

This is where the blacklist, for example, of your bank, will not allow you to easily make a transaction, he will say - this online store is bad, there are already 100,500 complaints about illegal debiting of money, and not shipping goods. If you want - then check the box &quot;I am notified of the negative rating of the store, and I am ready to lose my money.&quot; This is an objective example. But the fact that the forum has a rating of trust ratings does not bother you? Do you communicate here?

Not about some security guarantees and preventing you to get ripped off. That&#039;s not what Wasabi is claiming or trying to do.<br /><br />They&#039;re trying to establish a notion of &#039;untainted coins&#039; and <b>preventing you</b> from spending your coins, because <b>your coins are called dirty</b>. No matter if you try to send them to your grandma, theymos or an online scammer; they are not blacklisting &#039;recipients&#039;, but &#039;senders&#039;. This is not going to make your funds more secure and not preventing you from making mistakes. It just allows institutional investors to make sure if they mix their coins with yours, that your coins don&#039;t come from criminal origin.

Then I&#039;ll upset you - you are unlikely to arouse such interest among the &quot;intelligence&quot; :) No offense - 1% of the population can really be of interest to any services or company. 99% of analytics on the movement of funds - only extras for analytics, for advertising and other companies.

At first you were talking about the infringement of some of your rights, now you are talking about lies? Ok - give an example?<br /><br />4. You again confuse the concepts of confidentiality and privacy. The first relates to security, most likely data, the second - to privacy. I recommend comparing the lexical meanings of these words, it will expand understanding :)<br />I will even conduct an acquaintance, for free and without requiring you to show your passport :)<br />PRIVACY is a sphere of vital interests, life activity, emotions, affections of an individual, a private person, an individual, isolated from other public spheres. In this sphere, a person is autonomous, but not isolated, his relations with others are concentrated in it.<br /><br />PRIVACY - does not oblige you to process personal data only for the purposes that you initially stated. It does not oblige you to limit the data storage period. It does not require you to introduce yourself, tell the name of your company. Confidentiality means that you encrypted the data, closed access to it, and you, for example, have special means of restricting access to data inside your laptop.<br /><br /><br />PS &quot;I must say, you are a perfect representative for Wasabi - anti-privacy to the core.&quot; - and labeling those who have a different opinion is a &quot;good&quot; indicator :)</div>

Blacklists, tainted coins, kyc requirements, are all steps in that direction. There are also ATMs that didn&#039;t ask for kyc below certain amounts and have switched to asking for kyc for any amount, so less privacy there. <br /><br />All of that is a far cry from the original idea of P2P, just like when Satoshi wrote the whitepaper he sure wasn&#039;t thinking about lots of people paying capital gains tax.<br /><br />I would guess that all of you who are very concerned about this issue, and so called privacy, have a significant part of your net worth in &quot;private&quot; bitcoins so to speak, probably mixed, no wonder the vast majority of you work for Chip Mixer. And of course, it is normal that you are worried about these issues because they could blacklist your coins.<br /><br />I have to say that I am concerned about privacy, but to a certain extent. That&#039;s why I often pay in cash, or I don&#039;t post my life on Facebook or Instagram, for example. <br /><br />Room for privacy in the use of Bitcoin is going to be there in the future, but it will be reduced. Better get used to the idea.</div>

You don&#039;t write - plugin publishers - &quot;immediately stop passing my traffic through you?&quot; or &quot;&quot;firefox - you see all my traffic - don&#039;t do that ever again!&quot;&quot; ? Not ! You are using browsers whose technologies you do not know 100% of information about, but ALL YOUR REQUESTS go through them! At the same time, not a single browser has officially and openly said - &quot;we will track your traffic and offer to limit it&quot;. But here you are SILENT :) Although you are so worried about anonymity!? Or you, using the Internet, make purchases on Amazon, where 2 orders of magnitude more private information is collected about you - and here you are also silent! Go your claims to Wassabi - selective? :) Or is there a link to your protest in Google or Firefox, where you demand to stop passing your private traffic through their browser? :) NO, I&#039;m 100% sure! :)</div>

And people who are dishonest in their thoughts can use it for illegal actions, or to conceal such actions. And a certain control, I personally think, can and even should be. Moreover, this control is quite clearly described by items that are really illegal and immoral. If you don&#039;t do that, what are you afraid of?!<br /></div>I swapped just one word and your paragraph continues to make just as much sense. &nbsp;See how easy it is to get from imposing control onto one thing to imposing control generally?<br /><br />You see, crimes are used as a bad excuse to make privacy inexistent. &nbsp;How is it fair that my stuff has to be controlled and verified just because a minority is doing nasty stuff. &nbsp;Why am I supposed to be happy with imposing this control as a layer on top of Bitcoin if Bitcoin is supposed to be exactly NOT what Coin Join is doing today.<br /><br />If control is imposed over Coin Join. &nbsp;Do you think there is no way out for criminals? &nbsp;If KYC is imposed everywhere on this planet for anything you do, do you think there is no way out for criminals? &nbsp;What does it do really? &nbsp;Lower the crime by a few percent if any at all? &nbsp;If so, why should the majority suffer of privacy intrusion because of a minority?<br /><br />Tell me why is a criminal supposed to use Coin Join instead of cash again. &nbsp;I can do much shadier stuff with cash than I can do with Bitcoin. &nbsp;Yet Bitcoin seems to be the main problem while cash existed for how long? &nbsp;Oh. &nbsp;Wait. &nbsp;But Bitcoin&#039;s supply is limited, the authorities do not have a printing machine for it nor do they have control over it. &nbsp;What a coincidence to hate exactly the one technology you can not manipulate.<br /><br />Bitcoin is supposed to make you free. &nbsp;If we agree that control for Coin Join can be &#039;used for offenses&#039;, then why are we not also agreeing that turning into imposing certain mandatory control on the Bitcoin blockchain itself will be helpful against the same &#039;offenses&#039;. &nbsp;But we should scroll a bit back up and see what forum we are on. &nbsp;Bitcoin Talk. &nbsp;If someone disagrees Bitcoin should provide its users freedom then that someone may not fit very well with the Bitcoin Talk forum.<br /><br />While we are at it, why do we not impose public surveillance cameras in everyone&#039;s houses because without control who knows what they could be doing in there. &nbsp;In fact, why do you not put one right now in your bedroom and share the feed URL with us. &nbsp;After all, if you have nothing to hide then what are you afraid of? &nbsp;For what is worth, you could be murdering someone in there or keeping your own set of slaves under the bed. &nbsp;What is going on, are you doing something shady back there, DrBeer? &nbsp;<b>If you don&#039;t do that, what are you afraid of?!</b><br /><br />I could spin up anything privacy wise just like this and make it sound like it is going to make for the perfect crime less world. &nbsp;But while in theory it may sound like it does good to humanity, practically it will only make criminals steer away to yet another method of concealing their actions while our privacy dims out. &nbsp;Think Chat Control in Europe. &nbsp;All your chats, images et cetera moving through the servers of authorities. &nbsp;This means any picture of your baby, any nude your girlfriend has taken or worse, any naked picture of your baby will be in the hands of a complete stranger or, even worse, in the hands of multiple strangers. &nbsp;And then it sits in the servers of authorities to which who the hell knows who may be having access within the next decade. &nbsp;And they say all of this for the prevention of pedophilia? &nbsp;Does this really and actually make sense to anyone?<br /><br />If someone wants to take my privacy out and away just because they THINK control and surveillance actually does something good, then all I can say is f**k off. &nbsp;The utopian world some people think a cashless and surveillance filled society would turn into is actually the most dystopian world I can imagine. &nbsp;If you want that dystopian world, do not force me into it.<br /><br />-<br />Regards,<br />PrivacyG<br /></div><br /><br />Any idea can be brought to insanity and delirium, which you just showed perfectly :)<br /><br />Once again, explain how your PRIVATE life will suffer from the fact that someone analyzes the transaction blockchain? Once again I will point out to you - you are confusing personal life (privacy) with confidentiality! That&#039;s when you understand these concepts - you will immediately lose a lot of questions! :)<br /><br />&quot;While we are at it, why do we not impose public surveillance cameras in everyone&#039;s houses because without control who knows what they could be doing in there. In fact, why do you not put one right now in your bedroom and share the feed URL with us. After all, if you have nothing to hide then what are you afraid of? For what is worth, you could be murdering someone in there or keeping your own set of slaves under the bed. something shady back there, DrBeer? If you don&#039;t do that, what are you afraid of?!&quot; - here is the perfect proof of my words about your misunderstanding of privacy and confidentiality.<br /><br />Then I’ll bring it to insanity, following your example - never, take off your underwear and pants, and don’t unzip your fly when you go to the toilet - your fly and your underwear taken off is a gross violation of your rights, freedoms and confidentiality ... or privacy! Shame on the manufacturers of pants that are removed, and the manufacturers of zippers on the fly - to anathematize! The idea is identical to your thoughts ... Tell me - does it look stupid? :)<br /><br />Regarding everything else you wrote. Do you think the presence of the Criminal Code, prisons, and in some countries the death penalty - has reduced crime to 0? NO. I answer honestly! But significantly reduced the number of people willing to commit crimes. If we now remove the criminal code and the system of control and punishment - what do you think will happen?<br />Similarly here - it will make it more difficult or discourage criminals from using this mechanism, or reduce the number of applicants if they know that their illegal transaction is likely to be disclosed. These are all preventive measures.<br /><br />Regarding the control of transactions in bitcoin - how do you know that there is no such control? :)<br /><br />As a result - I&#039;m sorry, but I see no reason to continue the dialogue with you. You have your own opinion, I do not support it, but I do not forbid you to express it either :) And I have my own opinion! And so far, not a single supporter of either privacy or confidentiality (even in your text you jump from one concept to another) has been able to give arguments that are significant to me in the direction that the developers have done something very bad.<br />This is where I stop our dialogue, which can turn into an eternal correspondence, I wish you good luck and privacy, as well as confidential privacy everywhere and in everything all your life :)<br />Thank you for the information provided!<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60484058#msg60484058">Quote from: dkbit98 on July 01, 2022, 10:35:42 AM</a></div><div class="quote"><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60483907#msg60483907">Quote from: DrBeer on July 01, 2022, 10:12:06 AM</a></div><div class="quote">But you do not lament - &quot;browsers Google, Firefox, Apple, ... - they are watching me !!!&quot; </div>Are you drunk, on drugs or what? &nbsp;::)<br />I criticized google and other tracking products or services many times in this forum, and I don&#039;t have to explain this to you.<br />You can&#039;t compare internet browsers with Wasabi wallet, but you can compare local internet providers or countries with this wallet.<br />My provider or my country can restrict access to certain websites, BUT I can always play around their stupid rules and access websites I want with Tor or vpn, I can&#039;t do that with Wasabi.<br />Firefox, Chrome or any other browsers can&#039;t stop me to visit any website I want.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60483907#msg60483907">Quote from: DrBeer on July 01, 2022, 10:12:06 AM</a></div><div class="quote">NO, I&#039;m 100% sure! :)<br /></div>Yo, you are 100% crazy, and you are using to much smileys.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60480704#msg60480704">Quote from: n0nce on June 30, 2022, 10:14:46 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Why are you ghosting me (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60473435#msg60473435)? :(<br /></div>He is clearly avoiding to answer some question, and he thinks that only his opinion is correct.<br />It&#039;s very hard discussing with someone like this...<br /></div><br /><br />&quot;There are no arguments - just start insulting your opponent and attributing flaws to him&quot;?

Honestly, lots of the privacy advocates here in the forum also criticize when Firefox and Chrome add more telemetry, but also recommend switching to Chromium or LibreWolf. What&#039;s sketchy with Wasabi is that it had this major &#039;privacy selling point&#039; and now goes completely against the whole concept, so especially previous users feel betrayed and disappointed. Imagine you recommended Wasabi to your friends and family and now you have to go and tell everyone to stop using it again because they could put themselves in danger by using it.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to repeat what I already told icopress: in my opinion, someone <i>can</i> advertise for something in their signature, but point out issues with the product if they find some. They can also opt to just not talk about the service they&#039;re advertising for; no signature campaign I know of has such a requirement (defending the product / company). So you really don&#039;t need to decide between defending Wasabi or getting their money. You can most probably just admit that tainting is bad for privacy and Bitcoin and criticize their latest actions, without icopress kicking you from the campaign. They still get their advertising space and you&#039;ll still get your money. </div>

Honestly, lots of the privacy advocates here in the forum also criticize when Firefox and Chrome add more telemetry, but also recommend switching to Chromium or LibreWolf. What&#039;s sketchy with Wasabi is that it had this major &#039;privacy selling point&#039; and now goes completely against the whole concept, so especially previous users feel betrayed and disappointed.

And this significantly reduces the number of dubious participants. Regarding the article - I read it. Again - many things are &quot;far-fetched&quot;. The key message of the article is that once you have passed the KYC, you have transferred your data to a third party and you no longer control them. In part, I even agree. But I will add - all these supporters of the theory of total surveillance, for some reason forget that in life they leave their data hundreds and thousands of times wherever possible, and there their privacy does not suffer, but only KYC is universal evil. In a word - there is a potential risk of ANOTHER POINT of leakage of your data. But your private data is already more than enough, and if someone sets out to get information about you, this is not a problem.<br /><br />2. About slaves - exactly the same attempt to replace concepts and essence, as in the article about the dangers of KYC. Well, seriously - then you are talking about KYC and private information, then you come up with slaves that I hide. Beer, if I need it, I buy either in a pub or in a store where there is my data in loyalty programs at least. And nothing happened to me :) In your example, you are trying to impose your decision on me (&quot;Unless he can provide full surveillance of his home, we have to assume that, don&#039;t we.&quot;). And Wassabi - how are you being forced to use it? If so - then be sure to talk about it, forcing you to use their solution would indeed be a dubious move!<br /><br />3. About paid support for wassabi - there is such a saying &quot;do not judge by yourself&quot;, I hope you understand the meaning :) The problem is different - for many years I have been watching paranoid (can&#039;t be called otherwise) hysteria that someone can to follow or is already following, or will follow, or was definitely going to follow. Moreover, most of the &quot;evidence&quot; is akin to the theory of world conspiracies and similar near-scientific fantasies. I am for freedom of choice - both on the side of the developer (&quot;the artist sees the world this way&quot;), and the consumer (&quot;vote for the product with your choice&quot;). If you don&#039;t like something, change it! Or make your own. Or buy this developer company - and set your terms of reference.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">An interesting finding from OXT research team regarding flawed functionality of Wasabi Wallet&#039;s automatic CoinJoins and coin controls:<br /><br /><a href="https://i.gyazo.com/1cf6f6b2a1a80d0fe90e06e14aabaea7.png">https://i.gyazo.com/1cf6f6b2a1a80d0fe90e06e14aabaea7.png</a><br /><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FWmGT4kWAAA6Bge?format=jpg&amp;name=small">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FWmGT4kWAAA6Bge?format=jpg&amp;name=small</a><br />Link to the original tweet: https://twitter.com/ErgoBTC/status/1542912335513272327<br />Link to the graph: https://oxt.me/BOOKMARK/62BF2FA59B37195551184BB3<br /><br />From my understanding of the graph above, Wasabi Wallet&#039;s algorithm, despite close collaboration with Chainalysis firm, still allows &quot;dirty&quot; bitcoins (ransomware) to participate in CoinJoin transactions. Moreover, automatic coin control doesn&#039;t prevent unmixed toxic change from merging with mixed coins, making the whole mixing process useless. Honestly, I don&#039;t fully understand the graphs like this, so there might be some errors in my interpretation of the graph and comments on it.<br /><br />What we get when using Wasabi Wallet:<br /><br />1) chain surveillance firm spying on your transactions while not preventing criminals from conjoins<br />2) destroyed privacy due to flaws in coinjoin and automatic coin control algorithms</div>

But your private data is already more than enough, and if someone sets out to get information about you, this is not a problem.<br /></div>Right; so I was speaking more broadly, after all it&#039;s about Wasabi and about control. I was trying to say that just as KYC doesn&#039;t prevent crime (and can in fact encourage crime such as identity theft), other forms of control such as blacklisting coins, won&#039;t prevent crime. Analogously to the black market for identities and exchange accounts, a market for exchanging &#039;tainted&#039; against &#039;untainted&#039; UTXOs or for tools to bypass such filters, can and most probably will emerge.<br />In fact, witcher_sense just shared something about new methods that allow evading Wasabi&#039;s algorithm, which I&#039;ll have a look at now. <br /><br />Keep in mind your whole argument about &#039;weeell, people leave other PI information everywhere anyway&#039; is not only whataboutism (which makes it a bad argument automatically), it&#039;s also not necessarily true.

The aim was to show that the &#039;guilty until proven innocent&#039; philosophy is totally fucked up. It manifests itself in <b>mass surveillance</b> methodologies such as KYC requirements of exchanges, or, as in this case, <b>checking every user&#039;s UTXOs against a database</b>. Whoever does this, starts with the assumption that the user is guilty and the next step is checking if that&#039;s true or not. Instead of assuming the user is innocent, such as is actually the case in most legislations.<br />My claim that you have to install cameras to prove you don&#039;t have beer slaves, was an analogy to exchanges and services spying on <i>all</i> customers and / or <i>requiring <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> customers to provide KYC info</i>. They assume everyone to be guilty and everyone has to prove that they&#039;re not. It should be the other way round. I assume that 99.9999% of people don&#039;t have slaves, that&#039;s natural. But then why do I assume that 99.9999% of people buying BTC on Coinbase are criminal and need to get their ID documents? Why do I assume that 99.9999% of Wasabi users are criminal and need to check their UTXOs?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60487831#msg60487831">Quote from: DrBeer on July 01, 2022, 07:07:47 PM</a></div><div class="quote"><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60486014#msg60486014">Quote from: n0nce on July 01, 2022, 03:18:20 PM</a></div><div class="quote"><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60483907#msg60483907">Quote from: DrBeer on July 01, 2022, 10:12:06 AM</a></div><div class="quote">[...]<br />Great example!<br />But you do not lament - &quot;browsers Google, Firefox, Apple, ... - they are watching me !!!&quot; :)<br />If you don&#039;t like the browser or the plugin, you either disable it (the plugin) or change the browser!

Of course, that&#039;s what most people here did/do/will do. But I still believe this is a very important discussion for education and information of previous and new Wasabi users, who due to lack of communication [1] and explanations from the Wasabi side, might have no idea about the blacklist and reduced privacy [2].<br />The discussion is also important for giving Wasabi and other services some community feedback so they know what we value, what we like and don&#039;t like - this is way more kind than just boycotting Wasabi and not giving any explanations as of why.

Who is your target audience / target user demographic? Due to the recent changes, we must assume it&#039;s people who are interested in mixing coins, while at the same time not having a problem with the mixer discriminating between UTXOs. Mixing with a blacklist seems like an oxymoron to us and we struggle to see the use case.</div><b>Answer:</b> Our target audience is Bitcoiners.<br /><br />Many people seem to struggle understanding what zkSNACKs blacklisting really means and why we are doing it, so let’s start from the basics. ZkSNACKs is a company that sponsors the development of an open-source project called Wasabi Wallet. This company also runs the default coordinator that is needed to create coinjoin transactions in Wasabi. This coordinator service can be run by other entities too, as everything is open and available. Users are able to choose which coordinator they want to communicate with but unfortunately there are not many options, as running one has its risks and not many people are willing to do it.<br /><br />The zkSNACKs coordinator is clearly the largest and has substantially more liquidity than others; hence, this is why most people use it. Wasabi Wallet was built in a way that the developers and zkSNACKs don&#039;t collect any data about their users. We do not care who you are and what you do with your bitcoins! We don&#039;t want to know. Unfortunately, some people do collect data, attach it to bitcoin addresses and make decisions based on that information. The company is getting in trouble and harassed because apparently some of the users of our coordinator are so-called “criminals”, according to the people keeping up these databases.<br /><br />We are not saying that the database is correct, as we do not agree with most of the classifications but we want to be able to see the same information that apparently others already have. We don’t want to do any chain surveillance ourselves, so we would rather just buy that information from others. We are not interested in applying sanctions or other immoral crap. We are exercising our right as a company to choose not to serve those people who could get us in trouble and the ones whom we wouldn’t want to support for ethical reasons. This includes known thieves like politicians.<br /><br />Ostracization is, in our opinion, a libertarian way to react to the problems that have occured because of these high profile users. We are still not collecting data about our users nor are we revealing anything new to chain analysis companies. The blacklisting has no effect on users&#039; privacy.

Is it correct that you now officially focus on institutional investors and chose to implement a blacklist for this reason? Your blog post and other statements make it seem like this is the case. For example in this interview: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/364/, Max Hillebrand said: &#039;if you, as a CoinJoin coordinator, if you want to work with institutional clients, hedge funds, insurance funds, Michael Saylor, and all these people, well, even if ZKSnacks were not to be regulated, those customers might very well be, maybe because they&#039;re custodians of other people&#039;s money or whatnot. And then these regulated entities can only become users of a coordinator—arguably, I&#039;m not sure—if such a blacklisting is involved.&#039;</div><b>Answer:</b> No, we’re certainly not exclusively focusing on institutional investors and this has nothing to do with why we are implementing a blacklist.

Institutional investors are not our main target audience, bitcoin users in general are. Institutional investors are of course part of that group. We are extremely transparent and that’s the problem.

It’s an ability for you to choose what information you share with others. Institutional adoption for our wallet is more than just investors. It’s also the several exchanges conducting thousands of transactions daily.

Are you now making Bitcoin less valuable as money?</div><b>Answer:</b> Even though we have the saying “Don’t trust, verify” embedded in the bitcoin culture, very few seem to be actually doing that. We have not said that we would be buying services from the Chainalysis company. This is, again, projecting/assuming. We are going to buy info from a chain analysis company, but not from Chainalysis.

But in https://twitter.com/HillebrandMax/status/1537503087987937283, at 1:32:10, Aviv Milner says that &#039;the average person who&#039;s using the product especially if you&#039;re not in a situation where you&#039;re your life depends on it and there&#039;s a large government organization that&#039;s well funded that&#039;s looking to to find you and hunt you down if you&#039;re not in that extreme situation then wasabi provides an incredible amount of privacy&#039;.

Are there any insights on how you blacklist? Do you rely solely on the data from Chainalysis or do you pre- and / or post-process the data? Since we assume blacklists are used to block coins from illegal origins; which laws or rules are used to determine if an origin or past activity is legal or not? Since Bitcoin is a global currency tied to no nation in particular, it appears impossible to declare &#039;legality&#039; in this context. For example, copyright laws differ widely across the world; or when it comes to anything sexual, some stuff is illegal in certain countries, but totally legal in others. How can a legal ground be found to determine which UTXOs are &#039;good&#039; and which are prohibited?</div><b>Answer:</b> Chainalysis! = chain analysis. Let’s say we have 200 inputs wanting to register for a coinjoin. We take those and 200 other random bech32 UTXO’s that we send to their API. We get back a response where they let us know if any of these UTXOs match any of the categories and criterias zkSNACKs has set. Those addresses that we accept will proceed to the input registration, those that are blacklisted will get a notification that this UTXO is blacklisted. As a reminder, Wasabi coinjoin is built in a way that the user never loses control of their coins. The coordinator is never custodying users’ money, therefore it can not seize them etc. The querying process doesn’t affect users&#039; privacy. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60433827#msg60433827">Quote from: n0nce on June 24, 2022, 05:20:48 PM</a></div><div class="quote">14.

By the way: this is exactly what you predicted in your old docs pages; if everyone starts coming up with &#039;taint definitions&#039; and blacklists, using (moving) Bitcoin will become infeasibly cumbersome.</div><b>Answer:</b> Automatic coin selection and auto coinjoin are a good option for newbies who have no idea what they are doing but we totally understand that advanced users would like to have more insights and control. Features that enable these will very likely be added in the future in one way or another. Before users even open the wallet, they see our terms and conditions, which they have to accept in order to use the software. Coinjoins are considered inherently high risk by many chain analysis services and they are advocating their clients to block them all. Let’s see if a “blacklisted coinjoin” can get a lower score and we can remove the stigma from coinjoins. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60433827#msg60433827">Quote from: n0nce on June 24, 2022, 05:20:48 PM</a></div><div class="quote">22. Another quote from the same recent Twitter group chat: https://twitter.com/HillebrandMax/status/1537503087987937283 (at 1:32:40) - Aviv Milner says that &#039;Maybe there is a little more privacy in Lightning&#039;; and elaborates that LN is tricky to use though, so he implies that Wasabi is actually less anonymous / less private than Lightning, but just easier to use? Would you confirm that, that Wasabi CoinJoin privacy is lower than Lightning privacy? So if I need the absolute most privacy, you would recommend to create a Lightning channel and / or doing a submarine swap instead of doing a WasabiWallet CoinJoin? This is practical, important information for a lot of users who need as strong privacy guarantees as possible.</div><b>Answer:</b> For strong onchain privacy I don’t know anything better than coinjoin. You never know who’s coin you end up with in a swap. You should also open all your Lightning channels with coinjoined coins. Everything is shit, but this is the best we got. Better get to work if we want something more.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60433827#msg60433827">Quote from: n0nce on June 24, 2022, 05:20:48 PM</a></div><div class="quote">23. Right before, he also says that it&#039;s much more private than the vast majority of alternatives; what are those alternative privacy solutions that are much worse than WasabiWallet? Or did he talk about the &#039;alternatives&#039; as non-privacy-promising, plain and normal non-custodial wallets, with no CoinJoin implementation in them; that these are less private?</div><b>Answer:</b> See above.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60433827#msg60433827">Quote from: n0nce on June 24, 2022, 05:20:48 PM</a></div><div class="quote">24. For the last point, we have an important observation: <div class="quoteheader">Quote from: <a class="ul" href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60395578#msg60395578">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg60395578#msg60395578</a></div><div class="quote">Wasabi Wallet doesn&#039;t utilize any post-mix spending tools, and if part of the users practices bad spending behavior (like spending directly to a centralized exchange), then the other part of the users (more advanced) can potentially be deanonymized in a process of elimination.</div> If I recall correctly, this is also a potential issue / attack on other such mixing technologies; where bad behaviour (unintentional or even intentional) can put the privacy of other users at risk. This sounds like a loophole / security issue just looking to be exploited. Would you confirm this issues and if yes, are there any plans yet to improve this?</div><b>Answer:</b> Regarding the linked, no wallet can prevent users from consolidating coins if they want to. In Wasabi Wallet 1.0 users see a big warning when they try to spend private and non-private coins together. If they want to do it anyway, we should allow it. In 2.0 they see who knows about the transaction they are making but we should add more warnings. Creating a separate wallet for private coins doesn’t help as the user can still consolidate outside the wallet and it’s a very bad UX if sending all coins is urgent. Wasabi Wallet coinjoins are designed to be very large to make sure that even if many users consolidate, you’ll still have plenty of ambiguity from non-consolidated outputs. Deanonymization is a problem in smaller coinjoins with very few participants and low remix rate. Especially if users by default send the server their xpubs, like in Samourai Wallet.<br /><br />What are these post-mixing tools exactly? Ricochet is very expensive and doesn’t provide you any privacy. 6 hops between cj and exchange is something you can do manually with 10x lower price if you think that helps. Or do you mean small coinjoins after the main coinjoin that is supposed to make sure even the people who leak xpubs can get a little bit privacy from the service provider? Otherwise it’s just a crappy coinjoin.</div>

In rare cases where they are a bit smart they decide to go after hacks as well. But nobody goes after street scammers. A police force is practically non-existant.<br /><br />*I&#039;m thinking more in terms of the CAN-SPAM act against spam - true, it requires most mailing list publishers to provide a real, physical address (even if it&#039;s just a PO Box), but there are mailing lists that can be self-hosted without any address requirements.<br /></div>

Bitcoin gives you options and options give you freedom. If you have freedom, you are no longer as dependent on the government as you ideally should be. Ideally according to them.<br /><br />When it all gets too much for them, the elites could just decide that crypto is the haven for drug traffickers, hackers, pedophiles, terrorists, enemies of the West (Russia, North Korea, whatever is popular at the time), etc. To protect our people, we have decided to make crypto illegal. You have 3 months to get rid of it or face sanctions. Since you like digital currencies, we were kind enough to create this better bitcoin that is controlled and regulated by us (your savior&#039;s and protectors). Spend it any way you, like but for your own safety we have integrated this freeze button to stop you from spending too much or any at all because we love you and value your financial stability.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

Protection from government sanctions.</div>Even ignoring the very valid points BlackHatCoiner and n0nce have made above, there is absolutely no reason to think that this will provide protection from government sanctions. We have seen absolutely no mention from anyone - not from government, authorities, financial regulators, centralized exchanges, lending platforms, blockchain analysis firms, literally anyone - that once Wasabi start blacklisting and censoring that all outputs from Wasabi coinjoins will be treated as completely clean as if they have just been mined. And given what we know about what the government and authorities think about bitcoin and think about regular people having privacy, I think it is incredibly presumptive to expect this to happen.<br /><br />The more likely out come is that you coinjoin with Wasabi, pay them to spy on you, feed your data to blockchain analysis companies, and then end up with coins which are treated as suspect by various exchanges anyway. Given that it took major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase <i>years</i> to figure out how to support SegWit or how to batch their withdrawals, are people really expecting them to be able to tell the difference between coins which came from a Wasabi coinjoin or a Samourai coinjoin?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Guys.&nbsp; There is no need for a debate actually.&nbsp; Things are plain and simple.&nbsp; Imagine you worked as an investigative journalist, you always KNOW and are CONSCIOUS there will be threats and enemies.&nbsp; When you start being an investigative journalist, there are big downsides particularly when you investigate politics and corporations.<br /><br />There is absolutely zero difference between the above and being a Wasabi developer.&nbsp; I have an extremely high amount of doubt that Wasabi did not know they will at some point be threatened by certain corporations, three letter agencies, governments, public figures or whatever.&nbsp; They knew why some people are starting to love Bitcoin although they did not beforehand (Blockchain Analysis allows them today to do what they thought they could not years ago), they knew that three letter agencies of the United States will not like their idea of developing something that is focused on privacy, something that is focused on an idea they can not control.<br /><br />Now things become very simple.&nbsp; United States does not like you and you knew it.&nbsp; Why are you whining or telling us how hard it was for you to go through the threats?&nbsp; If you want to investigate a cartel, are you seriously going to complain they are threatening you?&nbsp; If that is the actual case, then these people are very immature.&nbsp; If that is not the case, then they either did not actually create Wasabi for privacy but with other intentions or they were bribed into turning Wasabi to the enemy boat.<br /><br />This is how it is for me.&nbsp; No matter how many threats they received.&nbsp; No matter how many things Governments did against Wasabi.&nbsp; These events were a known thing since before Wasabi turned from an idea into reality.<br /><br />It gets really frustrating and annoying though when people come in here telling me to choose &#039;an alternative&#039; if I do not like it.&nbsp; You know what, I am choosing an alternative.&nbsp; But you also know what?&nbsp; I have less and less alternatives every year.&nbsp; If a decade ago I could purchase food and stuff from multiple grocery stores around, today I mostly have corporations.&nbsp; If five years ago I could buy, sell and transfer Bitcoin through almost any exchange with only an e-mail and a password, today I have to complete KYC for about any exchange I would try to register for.&nbsp; Today we have &#039;taint&#039;.<br /><br />It is still cool that we have a few alternatives.&nbsp; Definitely not complaining about that.&nbsp; But freaking hell, it is getting frustratingly annoying that I have to &#039;look for something else&#039; every time while everybody else cares strictly about their own comfort and convenience.&nbsp; I just wish the solution to customers who have used Wasabi so far was far different than &#039;find an alternative&#039; because I am starting to find myself cornered.<br /><br />Rant over.&nbsp; Going back into my hut.<br /><br />-<br />Regards,<br />PrivacyG</div>

There was no pressure from any government agency to start blacklisting anything. They were not given a deadline to start blacklisting UTXOs or face sanctions otherwise. It was their decision to take this route. That&#039;s what they said at least. They might be lying about not being put under pressure, but I don&#039;t see why they would do that unless it&#039;s part of a deal. At least if a government agency came knocking on their door, they could use that as a bad excuse. The way things stand right now, they have no excuse and they started all this drama on their own. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></div>This is pure speculation, but if I&#039;m honest, I don&#039;t fully buy it that there were no threats. They declared it repeatedly and I do hold them accountable for that, but in other circumstances (Twitter comments and such) I get the feeling they&#039;re not 100% honest. If it was part of the deal to lie about it, statements like &#039;otherwise we had to shut it down&#039; make more sense.<br /></div><br />I&#039;m not so quick to doubt the Wasabi team that there were no &quot;threats.&quot; &nbsp;From my personal experience with the feds, they don&#039;t play the bad-cop roll and they don&#039;t lead with threats. &nbsp;Usually they play the long game, and try to get folks to comply on their own. &nbsp;If nopara73 was contacted by the feds, I would be willing to wager that he wouldn&#039;t describe the encounter as &quot;threatening.&quot; &nbsp;Of course this is all pure speculation, there&#039;s no evidence the feds did contact Wasabi.</div>
