					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The business world has become very competitive and in order to remain alive in the business for a long time, a business owner needs to be very proficient in many things, hard working, smart enough, financial capable and always keep his/her eyes on the customers.<br /><br />There are two very important elements that are crucial in running successfully any business. First is the strong business idea and the second one is all about marketing and management skills to be able to keep customers/clients interested in your business. If you are thinking of starting a business, it is good to have a strong business plan that includes all the necessary aspects of your business such as: market research, competition analysis, finances, marketing plan etc. To increase the chances of your business succeeding, you need to ensure that you are constantly updated with current business trends, educated enough to know all the possible market shifts and you must be able to make most informed decisions.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It is true that maintaining a business isn&#039;t easy and that&#039;s why a business that&#039;s already seeing its peak should maintain its consistency. That&#039;s all that matters in most businesses because even if you&#039;re the best right now.<br /><br />But, you&#039;re not consistent in what you do like marketing, customer support and innovation then you&#039;re going to be the last someday if you&#039;re not able to maintain that. Especially for these businesses that requires continuous upgrade and innovation, they&#039;ll be left behind if they don&#039;t accept that fact.</div>

It really requires a whole other level of commitment and multitasking ability. Depending on which business you choose, it can require learning all kinds of different and varied abilities. You might have to be the idea developer, the product manufacturer, the art designer, the accountant, the marketing manager and all sorts of other parts. Most people are also starting on a rather limited budget, or quickly use up their starting capital and end up losing a lot of money. Even if you are successful, things like burnout through overwork can easily creep up on you.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Building a business is not as easy as one might think. because in addition to being good at following ongoing trends, as business people we must be able to create trends that lead to our business. because following the trend sometimes won&#039;t last long. because the competition will be very tight. but creating a trend is a brilliant innovation in marketing. as before we know a small toy company such as toy cars and gansing. if we look at them, they seem to follow the trend among children who like to watch anime films about car racing fights. So does it last long? in fact not. but if we look deeper and more carefully, it turns out that the company has already designed the toy cars. and before being sold in the market, the company creates a trend first. by adopting an anime film and then the company helped the film to become famous and watched by many children. after the kids started liking the movie and fantasizing about owning the same thing as the main character in the movie. then that&#039;s when the toy company sells free toys that have been prepared for a long time in the market. and it is true that it immediately sells in the market.<br /><br />and after a dim trend. then the company did the same with different toys and different movies. Following trends and creating trends is difficult. but if it works. then the profit will be very much. Many toy companies do this.<br /><br />Some of the following tips should also be done in building a business, namely:<br />- Make and have a really mature plan.<br />- have creative ideas and fresh innovations.<br />- Can Follow Market Developments (be it following a trend or building a trend)<br />- study competitors.<br />- build good connections with many circles and companies as well as with customers.<br />- provide the best and friendly service to consumers and also to business partners.<br />- learn the desires of consumers.<br />- and maintain the welfare of workers or employees. so that they give the best hard work to the company and not on the basis of compulsion.<br /><br />actually there are many other tips. but in general the tips above are enough. So far we have seen many business companies go bankrupt due to not being able to keep up with market developments, market trends and not according to consumer wishes/consumer needs. this is something to be aware of.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The reasons why businesses (small scale and large corporations) fail and pull out of Nigeria is mostly due to insecurity, power and government policies. <br /><br />I don’t need to spell it out that when there isn’t peace and stability, business will definitely not thrive. <br /><br />You would also need power to run your business. And Nigeria presently can’t generate enough for its personal use<br /><br />Government policies in my opinion is the greatest hindrance of them all as a government could put in place policies and when a new government is elected, the old policies are thrown out and new policies are put in place that businesses would have to follow. <br />Government interference also plays a key role in the demise of businesses </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It is quite common for businesses to fail within the first five years. <br />Around 20% businesses fail during the first 2 years and 50% within the first 5 years lol<br />The numbers must be more skewed when it comes to Developing countries(like Nigeria)<br /><br />Businesses in poor countries tend to face greater challenges and obstacles than those in developed countries. This includes factors such as a lack of access to capital, limited infrastructure, corruption, and a lack of skilled workers. As a result, businesses in poor countries often have a lower success rate than those in developed countries.<br /><br />Starting a successful biz in Nigeria isn&#039;t going to be easy and can only be done by locals imo</div>

People are too worried about survival that they will only have access to basic goods and in a limited scale. Furthermore, even though there aren&#039;t customers for everyone, the concurrency is the same or even more expressive than in developed countries. There are too many sellers for too few buyers.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Please note that the business world is a world full of challenges, sometimes bringing in troublesome competitors.<br />This is where our expertise is tested in business.<br /><br />but the cause of the failure of a business is sometimes not because our business is bad or our marketing is not good. but the overall economic condition of the economy can be the real obstacle. when people&#039;s purchasing power decreases. and the price of goods continues to soar. At such times it is very difficult to maintain a business. it is not surprising that as a result of an economic crisis, many shops and companies were able to close, even factories that had been around for a long time had closed because they were unable to pay employee salaries due to the products produced there had been a decline in interest in the market so that they were not selling well.<br />There are many factors that can make a business fail. both internal and external factors.<br /><br />usually to maintain a business when we have many employees and at the same time income decreases. then the reduction of employees is the solution. despite the fact that the effectiveness is still 50:50 but it can minimize expenses. reduction of employees and reduction of production if it is a factory.<br />and today the global economic conditions are really worrying so that it is increasingly difficult for small businesses to survive.</div>

Unfavorable government policies and external factors like the war in Ukraine are silently killing businesses in my country. <br /><br />Due to inflation and reduction in government revenue, the government is over-taxing businesses, making them collapse. There are also businesses that have been witchhunt by the government because they supported or are supporting the opposition political party. Such businesses suffer and sometimes collapse because of the perceived political affiliation of their owners.<br /><br />In my lifetime, I have heard about or witnessed conflict or wars in different countries but the global effect of the war in Ukraine has given me a clear glimpse of the interconnection and interdependence of the world economies.

You will only be using your business finances to pay your endless debt if you will not be able to manage your funds well. If you&#039;ll borrow funds to keep your business running, you have to make sure that your return on equity is higher than the cost of debt and calculate your returns regularly or else your business will surely lead to bankruptcy. Debt can affect your bussiness the worse way if you are not able to meet its financial obligation so it really has a huge risk. </div>

Newbie entrepreneurs think that establishing a business is not difficult. They think that once money starts flowing into their business, they can relax and just wait for their investment to return. They forget to plan some contingency measures that can happen on their business in the future like if a typhoon or the pandemic last year which ruined many businesses.<br /></div>I don&#039;t think this is absolutely true as most new business entrepreneurs are planning way ahead on their business endeavors and most of them have a roadmap to follow through. Also, newbie entrepreneurs know how hard to handle a business before even starting one as they will need to against huge companies. <br /><br />I guess most new businesses fail to run in the long run due to not being able to follow up with the roadmap as well as compromising any delays that could happen on the roadmap planned. Another main reason why small businesses fail is that huge companies overwhelm them and they cannot keep up with the other big businesses&#039; pricing, marketing, and services. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The reason you gave above are just common sense because that&#039;s what you&#039;re comparing to the big projects. Small startup will have limited funds, limited person, higher risk to bankrupt, and lack of many thing. Obviously big projects already have big funds, many employee with brank office and bigger in many thing.<br /><br />Each startup will have different problem and mostly the problem is about their product aren&#039;t offering better feature with cheap price. If the project can create better product with cheap price, they can compete against the big projects.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Regardless of the type of business mentioned above, for me they are all examples of how a business stands not only about costs and adequate concepts. In business there are always ups and downs, therefore business can&#039;t run in one direction. For example, only targeting one particular consumer, if in it there are 2 or 3 target markets it might be much more stable. In today&#039;s digital era, businesses face big corporate competitors. As a business person, it is very important to pay attention to digital trends, because then adjusting to what the digital market needs can be fulfilled. One of them is digital marketing, this is clearly important in reaching market elements. Utilizing a video marketing platform as a means to highlight the products we have. <br /><br />Not only that, nowadays the use of smartphones is a must for young and old alike. That way we can direct them to a platform that we build to make it easier for them to explore what items they are looking for and need. Build a website to be accessible to every element or rather by building an online store. Give them the best 24-hour service, and evaluate each customer to provide as objective an assessment as possible so that our business continues to be updated according to consumer desires.</div>

Those businesses are also not small but a true small business won&#039;t be featured like that. I think OLX didn&#039;t fail but they only rebranded their website. It was now called carousel when I visited them last time.<br /><br />I remember I used this site before for selling some of my stuffs and got a good offers from different people. It was a fun experience though. Easy taxi may have failed but there are now uber and grab which are more popular.

I have heard/read almost all of the examples given in the OP and yes I have seen them failing. OLX is closely related to me as I have used it multiple times. The website is working till date but it&#039;s presence is next to zero. It&#039;s like surviving on it&#039;s final breaths these days. However one thing is sure, there are bigger players in the market as compared to them with bigger budget to spend on management and marketing etc. It&#039;s beautifully written article and every startup must note down them to save themselves from failing. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">More than 50% of small businesses failing within 5 years is a commonly touted statistic.<br /><br />I think most entrepreneurs make a mistake of thinking that starting a business has to be a large mega enterprise. Its much better to start small. Buying and selling items on local second markets. Having some type of profitable side hustle. It could be as low key as cleaning parking lots. Or cutting lawns. Starting a business is better to not be something people pour all of their time and life savings into. It should be a casual thing and natural progression that is done on the side. If incorporating, large expenses and other extras are tacked on. I think those extra and unnecessary steps greatly increase chances of failure.<br /><br />A good educational system would give students real life experience owning and operating a small business. That is something that is very necessary and needed in this day and age.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree that there is a good reason why we can&#039;t really understand what could happen for us to fail, but we need to realize one huge and important thing, which is debt. Most of the companies that you see end up working towards the fine line between bankrupting and success, because they spend everything they get to grow, and that causes companies to be always in trouble, one big mistake and you are done because you can&#039;t pay for that mistake without getting paid and if it&#039;s a mistake you can&#039;t get paid.<br /><br />Even Tesla and Amazon had this, they had plenty of times when it looked like they would fail, and instead they ended up working out but it was very close for both of them at times.</div>

This situation has a very negative impact on individual businessmen and many consequently have to close the doors at some point.<br /></div> The reason why businesses whether big or small should always have sufficient capital so that the production will always be consistent, and if ever there are sales decline, there are still good amount left that will cover the shortage. Also, in building businesses, it’s also important to consider the population of the consumers and specifically their demands too so that you will create quality products that will be consumed by a large amount of consumers.</div>

As a result, businesses in poor countries often have a lower success rate than those in developed countries.<br /></div>I see as a major difficult in developing countries the fact people don&#039;t have much money to spare, so you as a business owner have a very limited customers&#039; base to acquire your services and products. People are too worried about survival that they will only have access to basic goods and in a limited scale.

This situation has a very negative impact on individual businessmen and many consequently have to close the doors at some point.<br /></div> This is the reason why as a business owner, you should always search for the best outlet where to build your business, otherwise your business won&#039;t work not only because of few customers, but also the products you are selling are not the ones they mostly wanted. In search for the demands of the customers, you should have a thorough research first and start a survey because that will determine the success of your business.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Most of the companies that you have stated seems to be an international company or companies formed in other countries trying to expand in your country. I wouldn&#039;t blame them if they had to shut operations. Like you have said they shut down due to &quot;operational difficulties&quot;. I guess it was some issues with the government or the local laws that has changed or due to some changes their profits are no longer enough to run their business in your country.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t call them &quot;small-scale entrepreneurs&quot; if they have franchises and expanded to other other countries.</div>

In fact, maintaining a business is not simple, it includes hundreds of different factors, not only capital management, planning, poor customer care support...Nowadays, every field will have extremely fierce competition, so opening a company or business is simple but maintaining it somehow is the problem.<br /><br />There are many people who always say that there is no fairness in business when the director is paid dozens of times more than the workers. But we can see that to run and find a way to survive for a business is an extremely difficult thing, not everyone has the courage to do it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Perhaps of the many young entrepreneurs, only a few can really successfully run their businesses. They are the ones who can learn from anywhere to gain more knowledge and also often try trial and error in business so they can find the right formula for them. Each entrepreneur must have their own formula so that their business can run well and if they get a formula from someone else on how to run their business, they have to adapt it to their circumstances. It will be better because they can find what works for them and help them achieve success.</div>

There are a lot of factors and sacrifice that we need to do and there is no formula that really fits everyone to be successful. So it will be a trial and error in the initial and this is where it going to make or break new and young businessman. Hopefully, they will adapt, and only handful can achieved success because it is very difficult if you don&#039;t have the expertise or no one is mentoring you. Going to be a struggle, but for those who succeed, it will be worth.</div>

It is better to weigh everything and understand that a person is not yet ready for entrepreneurship than to take risks, implying a loss in advance. What are their failures if they have not lost anything? Another thing is when a person is dominated by excessive self-confidence, without a clear understanding of all the risks.<br />It&#039;s not scary to be confident, but it&#039;s scary when people are overconfident.</div>

Nokia is well recognized globally but failed to continue to dominate due to few reasons resulting to its downfall.<br /><br />I also have have a business that is running for years now. The profit is unstable but we managed to survive even there are many new competitors sprouting in our place. It might because we are already well known here and had a loyal customers who gained their trust that&#039;s why they keep coming back. We also dont stop marketing our business and giving promotions. It takes guts to be an entrepreneur since you&#039;ll never know the outcome but if you are determine to succeed then you have to do the best that you can. If you&#039;re too complacent and not competitive there&#039;s a high chance for other competitors to take over.</div>

Because in business, especially for small businesses, it is clear that we do not have to set high targets to fit our budget.<br />Actually, in this case insufficient capital can occur for several reasons and indeed for a small business, it will be more or less affected by capital, even though what you say is starting from small to big, but in this case, adequate money management is needed so that things like capital do not happen which is not adequate.<br /></div><br />I got your point here, business line has several requirements for each stages and level a business want to operate in, this is a determination of the business idea itself, then we can come to say that some business just need an adequate start up capital bade on the nature of the venture while some can manage to start small and grow big to develop into the standard required one, the vision mandate of every business enterprise is different and so is their financial capacity required, the least a business may require can be the highest another may needed to operate with, therefore understanding the particular nature of a business can help direct it requires funding capital adequately for effective utilization. </div>
